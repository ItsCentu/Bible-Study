# Short Answer:

Dinosaur bones are **exactly what they look like**, the remains of giant, extinct reptiles that lived **before and during the global flood**, around **4,400 years ago**.  
They don’t prove evolution or millions of years, they fit **perfectly** in the biblical timeline when interpreted correctly.

# What the Bible Says

The Bible doesn’t use the word “dinosaur” (coined in the 1840s), but it **does describe creatures** that match what we call dinosaurs:

### 1. **Behemoth**

> _“Behold, Behemoth… he eats grass like an ox… his bones are tubes of bronze… his tail sways like a cedar.”_  
> — **Job 40:15–18**

→ This is **not** a hippo or elephant (they don’t have “cedar-like tails”) — it matches a **sauropod dinosaur** (like a Brachiosaurus or Apatosaurus).

### 2. **Leviathan**

> _“Can you pull in Leviathan with a fishhook?... His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.”_  
> — **Job 41:1–21**

→ This sounds like a **marine reptile** (like a Mosasaur or Kronosaurus) with possible chemical defense like some beetles have today.

# What Are Dinosaur Fossils?

Dinosaur fossils are the **rapidly buried remains** of creatures that died during **catastrophic events** — primarily the **global flood** in Genesis 6–9.

Fossils don’t form slowly — they require **quick burial** in sediment to preserve bones before decay sets in.

## Evidence Dinosaurs Didn’t Live Millions of Years Ago

### 1. **Soft tissue and blood cells**

- Soft tissues, collagen, and even red blood cells have been found in dinosaur bones.
    
- These materials **cannot survive millions of years**, most break down in thousands of years or less.

> Dr. Mary Schweitzer (not a creationist) discovered blood vessels and flexible tissue in T-Rex bones. Her findings shocked the scientific world.

### 2. **Carbon-14 in dinosaur bones**

- Carbon-14 decays relatively quickly. If dinosaurs were **millions of years old**, there should be **no detectable C-14** in their bones.
    
- But C-14 has **been found** in multiple dinosaur fossils — meaning they are **thousands, not millions**, of years old.

### 3. **Dinosaur tracks with human footprints**

- In places like **Glen Rose, Texas**, there are fossilized **human and dinosaur tracks side-by-side**.
    
- Controversial? Yes. Disproven? No. Suppressed? Often.

### 4. **Global fossil graveyards**

- Mass fossil sites around the world show **mixed species**, twisted and buried **violently**, consistent with a massive flood, not peaceful death over millions of years.

# Dinosaurs and the Flood

- Most dinosaurs likely **perished in the flood**, their bodies rapidly buried in sediment.
    
- Noah may have brought **young, small members of each “dinosaur kind”** aboard the ark (Genesis 6:19–20).
    
- After the flood, due to new environmental changes (post-flood world, harsher climate, limited food), **many species went extinct** — including dinosaurs.

# Why This Matters

The narrative of “dinosaurs prove evolution and millions of years” is built on a **secular worldview**, not neutral science.  
When we start with **God’s Word**, dinosaurs become evidence of:

- **God’s creative power**
    
- **A global judgment**
    
- **Biblical accuracy**, not myth

# Final Summary Answer

Dinosaur bones are **real, powerful evidence of the Bible’s truth** when interpreted correctly:

- They show **rapid death and burial** (flood)
    
- They contain **soft tissue and carbon-14** (recent origin)
    
- They match descriptions in **Job**
    
- They fit within the **6,000-year biblical timeline**
    

The question isn’t whether dinosaurs existed — it’s: **how do you interpret the evidence?**  
And the Bible gives a better, clearer answer than secular science can.
