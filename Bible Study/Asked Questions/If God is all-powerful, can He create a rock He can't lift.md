## Short Answer:

- No, because logical contradictions are not acts of power but of nonsense. God's omnipotence means He can do **all things that are possible**—not logically absurd or self-contradictory tasks.

## What the Bible Says:

- **God is All-Powerful:**
    
    - > _“For nothing will be impossible with God.”_ — Luke 1:37
        
    - > _“Our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.”_ — Psalm 115:3
        
- **God Cannot Contradict His Nature:**
    
    - > _“God cannot lie.”_ — Titus 1:2
        
    - > _“He cannot deny Himself.”_ — 2 Timothy 2:13
        

These verses show that God's power is perfect but **not self-contradictory**. He can do all that is logically consistent with His nature and truth.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- This question is based on a **misunderstanding of omnipotence**, thinking it means "doing the logically impossible."
    
- It creates a **paradox** (a trick question) meant to "trap" logic by combining two contradictory ideas:
    
    - A rock too heavy for an all-powerful being.
        
    - A being who is supposedly unable to lift it.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

- **Logical Explanation:**
    
    - This is like asking: “Can God draw a square circle?” or “Can God make 2 + 2 = 5?” These are not real things—they’re **logical contradictions**, not feats of strength or ability.
        
- **Philosophical Clarity (C.S. Lewis):**
    
    - “Nonsense does not cease to be nonsense when we add the words ‘God can’ before it.”
        
    - God’s omnipotence is **not** the power to do what is **nonsensical**, but the power to do **anything that makes sense**.

## Encouragement:

- God is not limited in power—He is unlimited in **wisdom, justice, and truth**.
    
- Instead of getting stuck on word tricks, know that the **same God who raised Christ from the dead** is not confused by paradoxes or riddles.
    
- He’s not weak because He can’t lie or deny Himself—that’s part of what makes Him perfect and trustworthy.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- This question is often used by skeptics not to seek truth, but to mock belief in God.
    
- Responding well shows we understand both **philosophy** and **faith**.
    
- Omnipotence means God has **unlimited power** within the realm of what is **rational and real**—not within human-created paradoxes.
    
- It's a **category error**—asking if God can do something that **violates the definition of God Himself**.

## Final Summary Answer:

- God cannot create a rock He can’t lift—not because He’s weak, but because the question is meaningless.
    
- God’s omnipotence includes all **possible** acts, not **logical absurdities**.
    
- The question misunderstands the nature of divine power—our God is not bound by nonsense, and that’s a good thing.
