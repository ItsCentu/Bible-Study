## Short Answer:

- God Himself is the **source of light**—He does not need the sun to create or sustain light.
    
- In Genesis, light was created on **Day 1**, while the sun, moon, and stars were created on **Day 4**. This reveals God’s **sovereign power** and that light doesn’t depend on celestial bodies—it depends on **Him**.

## What the Bible Says:

- **Day 1 — Light Created:**
    
    - > _“And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light… and God separated the light from the darkness.”_ — Genesis 1:3–4
        
- **Day 4 — Sun, Moon, and Stars Created:**
    
    - > _“Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens… the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night.”_ — Genesis 1:14–16
        
- **God Is Light:**
    
    - > _“God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.”_ — 1 John 1:5
        
    - > _“The city does not need the sun or the moon… for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.”_ — Revelation 21:23  
        > In the beginning **and in the end**, **God Himself provides light**.
        

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes light must come **only** from the sun, based on current natural processes.
    
- Forgets that **Genesis is a record of divine acts**, not limited by the created order.
    
- Imposes modern scientific expectations on **pre-formed, miraculous creation events**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Light Can Exist Without the Sun:**

- **Light is a form of energy (photons)**. It can exist independently of the sun—like from a flashlight, fire, or electricity.
    
- In physics, **light and heat are not inherently dependent** on the sun—they’re forms of **electromagnetic radiation**.
    

### 2. **Order Matters Theologically:**

- God creating light first shows **He is the source of all life and energy**, not the sun.
    
- The sun becomes a **secondary agent** of light—**not to be worshipped** (as many ancient cultures did).
    

### 3. **Revelation Confirms This Pattern:**

- The New Jerusalem (in Revelation 21) has **no sun or moon**, yet is filled with light—because **God’s glory illuminates everything**.
    
- This mirrors Genesis: **light before the sun** in both the **beginning** and the **end**.

## Encouragement:

- God doesn’t need the tools of creation to act—He speaks, and **reality obeys**.
    
- The fact that light came before the sun shows that:
    
    - God is not dependent on anything.
        
    - The natural order is **subject to His will**, not the other way around.
        
- > _“Let there be light…”_ reminds you that **even in darkness, His Word brings light**.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Skeptics mock this verse without understanding that **God transcends His creation**.
    
- The Genesis account is not myth—it **intentionally breaks from pagan views** that worshipped the sun and moon as gods.
    
- God delays creating the sun until Day 4 to show **He alone is God**—not the cosmos.
    
- > _“By the word of the Lord the heavens were made…”_ — Psalm 33:6  
    > God spoke light into being before He placed the lights in the sky.

## Final Summary Answer:

- Light existed before the sun because **God Himself is the source of light**.
    
- Genesis shows us that the sun isn’t ultimate—**God is**.
    
- This order isn’t a contradiction—it’s a deliberate declaration of **God’s power, sovereignty, and authority over all creation**.
