## Short Answer:

- The books of the Bible weren’t chosen by one person or council—they were **recognized** over time by God’s people because they were clearly **inspired, authoritative, and consistent** with God’s truth.
    
- The early church **affirmed** what was already accepted—not invented it.

## What the Bible Says:

- **God Is the True Author:**
    
    - > _“All Scripture is God-breathed…”_ — 2 Timothy 3:16
        
    - > _“The word of the Lord endures forever.”_ — 1 Peter 1:25
        
- **God Uses People to Preserve His Word:**
    
    - > _“Men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”_ — 2 Peter 1:21
        
    - The process was human, but **guided by the Holy Spirit**.
        
- **The Church Recognizes, Not Creates, Scripture:**
    
    - > _“My sheep hear My voice…”_ — John 10:27  
        > The early believers recognized God’s voice in true Scripture.
        
## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes the Bible was selected **like a book club** or politically manipulated by councils (e.g., Council of Nicaea—**which didn’t even deal with canon**).
    
- Assumes some powerful people added or removed books for control.
    
- Fails to distinguish between **recognizing inspiration** and **creating Scripture**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Old Testament Canon:**

- The Jewish people recognized **39 books** (same as our Old Testament) as inspired over centuries.
    
- Jesus and the apostles quoted them as Scripture but never questioned their authority (see Luke 24:44).
    
- Books like the **Apocrypha** were known, but not treated as Scripture by Jesus or the apostles.
    

### 2. **New Testament Canon:**

- Written by **apostles or their close companions** (e.g., Mark with Peter, Luke with Paul).
    
- Circulated and used in churches **immediately** (see Colossians 4:16).
    
- Early Christians **already recognized most NT books by the 2nd century**.
    
- **Criteria for inclusion:**
    
    - Apostolic authority.
        
    - Consistency with existing Scripture.
        
    - Widespread usage in the early church.
        
    - Doctrinal integrity.
        

### 3. **Councils Affirmed What Was Already Used:**

- The **Council of Carthage (397 A.D.)** and others didn’t decide the canon—they simply **confirmed** the already accepted books across the church.
    
- No **new books** were added later—they only affirmed what was already in practice.

## Encouragement:

- You can trust that **God preserved His Word**, not because of church politics but because of **divine providence**.
    
- > _“The words of the Lord are pure words… You, O Lord, will keep them.”_ — Psalm 12:6–7
    
- The Bible you read today has **stood the test of time, scrutiny, persecution, and criticism**—and it still changes lives.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- The Bible was not chosen in a smoke-filled room by corrupt leaders—it was shaped by **real people**, led by the **real Spirit of God**, based on **real writings**, and **real events**.
    
- **Other so-called gospels** (like the Gospel of Thomas or Judas) were written **much later**, lacked apostolic connection, and were full of **false doctrine**.
    
- If the Bible was manipulated for control, **why include the sins of its heroes**, the failures of the apostles, and the crucifixion of its Messiah?  
    No man-made religion would write like this.

## Final Summary Answer:

- The books of the Bible were not randomly picked—they were **recognized as God’s Word** based on clear evidence of divine inspiration, apostolic authority, and doctrinal truth.
    
- The canon was not controlled by power-hungry men—it was **guided by the Holy Spirit**, confirmed by the early church, and proven trustworthy for over 2,000 years.
    
- You can trust the Bible—not because men chose it, but because **God preserved it**.
