## Short Answer:

- No. Science doesn’t disprove the Bible—it actually **confirms and supports** many biblical truths.
    
- Real science and the Bible **do not contradict**; they **complement** each other when properly understood. The conflict is not between science and Scripture, but between **naturalism** and **supernatural revelation**.

## What the Bible Says:

- **God Created the Natural World:**
    
    - > _“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”_ — Genesis 1:1
        
    - > _“By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command…”_ — Hebrews 11:3
        
- **Creation Reveals God’s Power:**
    
    - > _“The heavens declare the glory of God…”_ — Psalm 19:1
        
    - > _“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities… have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made.”_ — Romans 1:20
        
- **God Is the Author of Order and Laws:**
    
    - > _“He fixed the order of the moon and the stars…”_ — Jeremiah 31:35
        
    - Science depends on the **consistency and order** that God designed.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes that science and faith are **opposing forces**—but many scientists throughout history were **Bible-believing Christians**.
    
- Equates **science with naturalism**, the belief that only physical things exist.
    
- Misunderstands the Bible’s genre, context, and language—expecting it to be a **science textbook**, which it never claims to be.
    
- Confuses **scientific interpretation** (which can change) with **scientific facts** (which are observed).

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Many Scientific Fields Were Founded by Christians:**

- Isaac Newton (physics), Blaise Pascal (math), Gregor Mendel (genetics), and Johannes Kepler (astronomy) were all **Bible-believing scientists**.
    
- They studied nature to understand **God’s design**, not to disprove Him.
    

### 2. **Science Can’t Answer Spiritual Questions:**

- Science explains the **how**, but not the **why**.
    
- It can study creation, but it cannot speak to the Creator without going **beyond its limits**.
    
- Questions like:
    
    - “What is our purpose?”
        
    - “Why is there evil?”
        
    - “What happens after death?”  
        —these are **spiritual**, not scientific.
        

### 3. **Bible Has Scientific Insights Before Their Time:**

- Earth is suspended in space:
    
    > _“He hangs the earth on nothing.”_ — Job 26:7
    
- Hydrological cycle:
    
    > _“He draws up the drops of water… they pour down as rain.”_ — Job 36:27–28
    
- Human life in the blood:
    
    > _“The life of a creature is in the blood.”_ — Leviticus 17:11  
    > These were recorded **long before modern science discovered them.**
    

## Encouragement:

- You don’t need to fear science—it’s the **study of God’s creation**.
    
- God gave us minds to explore the world He made. When done honestly, **science leads to worship**.
    
- > _“Great are the works of the Lord; they are pondered by all who delight in them.”_ — Psalm 111:2

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- **Science cannot disprove miracles**—it only studies repeatable, natural processes.  
    Miracles are **supernatural**, not **anti-natural**—they are rare interruptions by the God who made the rules.
    
- **Atheistic scientists** may interpret data in a way that excludes God, but the data itself often points to **design, order, and intelligence**.
    
- Key scientific discoveries **support a biblical worldview**:
    
    - The universe had a beginning (Big Bang = “In the beginning…”).
        
    - The universe is finely tuned (points to design).
        
    - DNA contains **information**—which always comes from **intelligence**.

## Final Summary Answer:

- Science does **not** disprove the Bible.
    
- Instead, when interpreted honestly, science points toward a **Creator**, **design**, and the **truth** of God’s Word.
    
- The Bible and true science walk hand in hand—because **God is the Author of both nature and Scripture**.
