# Short Answer:

This issue is **not about facts**. It's about how the facts are **interpreted through your worldview**.  
The Bible teaches a **young earth**, and the "millions of years" claim comes from **assumptions** behind radiometric dating, not absolute facts.  
We have **two different starting points**:

- **Man’s interpretation of nature** vs
    
- **God’s revealed Word in Scripture**

# What the Bible Says

- The Bible gives a clear timeline from Adam to Jesus (Genesis 5 & 11; Luke 3), covering around **4,000 years** to Christ.
    
- We now live ~2,000 years after Jesus, making the earth roughly **6,000 years old** according to the **biblical genealogical record**.

# What About Rocks, Trees, and Radiometric Dating?

## 1. **Radiometric dating is based on assumptions**

Radiometric methods (like carbon-14, uranium-lead) are not direct clocks. They rely on **three unprovable assumptions**:

- The original amount of radioactive material (parent/daughter ratio)
    
- That decay rates have stayed constant
    
- That nothing has altered the sample (like water, pressure, contamination)
    

### Example: Mount St. Helens

Rocks formed after the 1980 eruption were dated as **hundreds of thousands to millions of years old** — even though they were only a few decades old.  
→ This shows that dating methods can be **wildly inaccurate** when assumptions are wrong.

## **Many scientists reject deep-time dating**

Thousands of qualified scientists reject the idea that the earth is millions of years old — not because of blind faith, but because:

- The assumptions behind dating are flawed.
    
- Observational evidence fits better with a **catastrophic global flood**.
    
- The **existence of soft tissue in dinosaur fossils**, helium in zircon crystals, and carbon-14 in diamonds all suggest a **young age**.

## **Trees and Ice Cores Can Be Misread**

- **Tree rings (dendrochronology):** More than one ring can form per year under the right conditions (like during rapid post-flood regrowth).
    
- **Ice cores:** Layers assumed to represent years can form rapidly in storms. Planes buried in Greenland in the 1940s had **dozens of “annual” layers** over just 50 years.
    

So what looks like “millions of years” may actually be **a short period with intense activity** — such as what would follow a global flood (Genesis 6–9).

# Global Flood Changed Everything

The worldwide flood described in Genesis would explain:

- Massive fossil layers (quick burial)
    
- Sediment layers across continents
    
- Rapid formation of canyons and rock layers
    
- Marine fossils on mountaintops
    
- The re-setting of radiometric “clocks” through heat, water, and pressure

# Final Summary Answer

The 6,000-year-old earth is based on the **clear genealogical and historical record in the Bible**.  
Dating methods that claim “millions of years” are built on **human assumptions**, and often **contradict observable evidence**.  
Many scientific discoveries actually support a **young earth and a global flood**.  
This isn’t about science vs faith — it’s about **worldview vs truth**.
