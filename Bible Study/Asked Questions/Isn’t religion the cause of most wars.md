## Short Answer:

- Contrary to popular belief, **religion is not the main cause of most wars**.
    
- Most conflicts stem from **politics, greed, power, and territory**, not genuine religious conviction.
    
- True Christianity calls for **peace, humility, and love**, not violence.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.”_ — Matthew 5:9
    
- > _“Put your sword back in its place… for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.”_ — Matthew 26:52
    
- > _“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”_ — Matthew 5:44
    
- > _“If it is possible… live at peace with everyone.”_ — Romans 12:18
    
- > _“The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable…”_ — James 3:17
    

Jesus never commanded violence — He called for **sacrifice, service, and peace**.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes that **all religion is dangerous**, and **faith = fanaticism**.
    
- Often based on **selective history** or emotional reaction to abuses.
    
- Fails to distinguish between **true believers** and those who misuse religion for power.
    
- Generalizes **all religions** together without analyzing motives behind wars.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Historical Data Doesn’t Support the Claim:**

- The _Encyclopedia of Wars_ (Phillips & Axelrod) examined 1,763 wars in recorded history.  
    → **Only about 7%** were religious in nature.  
    → Of those, **Christianity was responsible for less than 3%**.
    
- The **deadliest regimes** in history were **atheistic** or **anti-religious**:
    
    - Stalin (USSR)
        
    - Mao Zedong (China)
        
    - Pol Pot (Cambodia)  
        → Combined, they killed over **100 million** people.
        

### 2. **Most “Religious Wars” Are Really About Power:**

- The Crusades, for example, were as much about **land, revenge, and politics** as they were about religion.
    
- Modern terrorism often uses **religious language**, but is driven by **political, tribal, or economic goals**.
    

### 3. **True Christianity Does Not Promote War:**

- Jesus **never led or approved of holy war**.
    
- The early church **refused to fight**, even under persecution.
    
- Christians are told to **turn the other cheek**, not take up the sword (Matthew 5:39).

## Encouragement:

- If you’ve seen religion used for violence or control — **you’re not alone**, and **God condemns that too**.
    
- > _“Woe to those who call evil good and good evil…”_ — Isaiah 5:20
    
- Christianity isn’t about forcing others to believe. It’s about **freely receiving grace** and **loving others well**.
    
- Don’t judge Jesus by the actions of those who **disobeyed Him**.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- This claim is often used as a **smokescreen** to avoid dealing with personal accountability to God.
    
- The question isn’t “Has religion caused harm?” — it’s **“What does the actual teaching say?”**  
    → **Jesus taught peace, not violence.**
    
- Atheism, nationalism, and secular ideologies have done **far more damage**, yet people rarely criticize those with the same intensity.

## Final Summary Answer:

- The idea that religion causes most wars is a **myth**, not a fact.
    
- Most wars are driven by **power, pride, or politics**, not genuine religious belief.
    
- While some misuse religion, **true Christianity promotes peace**, not violence — because its Founder **died for His enemies** instead of killing them.
