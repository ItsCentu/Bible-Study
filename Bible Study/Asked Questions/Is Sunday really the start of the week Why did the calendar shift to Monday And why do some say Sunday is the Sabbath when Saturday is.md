## Short Answer:

- **Biblically**, Sunday is the **first day of the week**, and **Saturday is the seventh — the Sabbath**.
    
- Some modern calendars begin on **Monday** for business reasons, but that’s not biblical.
    
- **Sunday worship** began after the resurrection of Jesus, but **Saturday remains the biblical Sabbath**.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy… the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God.”_ — Exodus 20:8–10
    
- > _“On the first day of the week we came together to break bread.”_ — Acts 20:7
    
- > _“Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene… came to see the tomb.”_ — Matthew 28:1
    
- > _“Six days you shall labor, but the seventh is a Sabbath to the Lord…”_ — Exodus 16:26
    
- > _“Let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.”_ — Colossians 2:16

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- **Modern culture** assumes Monday starts the week due to the work schedule.
    
- Some assume **Sunday became “the Sabbath”** because of tradition, not Scripture.
    
- Confusion arises from **Catholic influence**, **Gregorian calendar reforms**, and **secular week structures**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Sunday Is Biblically the First Day of the Week:**

- Jewish tradition (and Genesis itself) identifies **Saturday as the 7th day**, the Sabbath.
    
- Jesus rose on the **first day of the week** — Sunday (Matthew 28:1, Mark 16:2, Luke 24:1).
    
- The **early church gathered on Sunday** in honor of the resurrection (Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 16:2) — not to replace the Sabbath, but to worship.
    

### 2. **Why Modern Calendars Start on Monday:**

- The **International Organization for Standardization (ISO 8601)** made Monday the official first day of the week for **business standardization** in many countries.
    
- It had **nothing to do with Scripture** — it was for convenience in modern work schedules.
    

### 3. **Why Sunday Was Called “The Sabbath”:**

- The **Catholic Church** historically encouraged Sunday as a day of worship, calling it the “Lord’s Day” (Revelation 1:10).
    
- Over time, Sunday became **associated with rest** in Christian nations, and many **called it “the new Sabbath”** — though the Bible never redefined it.
    
- The **Sabbath was never changed** by God — Saturday remains the 7th day.

## Encouragement:

- Whether you observe Saturday or Sunday, the heart of the matter is **resting in and honoring God**.
    
- > _“The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.”_ — Mark 2:27
    
- You don’t have to be confused by calendars — God sees the heart, not the grid.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Some accuse Christians of “changing God’s law” — but most Christians **worship on Sunday** to celebrate Jesus’ **resurrection**, not to claim it’s the literal Sabbath.
    
- **Seventh-day groups (like Seventh-day Adventists)** still observe Saturday Sabbath and challenge others on this issue.
    
- Paul teaches that we’re not to judge each other over **Sabbath observance** (Colossians 2:16) — the **New Covenant emphasizes the spirit, not the legalism**.

## Final Summary Answer:

- **Biblically, Sunday is the first day**, and **Saturday is the Sabbath (7th day)**.
    
- Modern calendars start with Monday for secular business reasons, not biblical ones.
    
- Worshiping on Sunday began with the **early church honoring Jesus’ resurrection**, but the Sabbath was **never scripturally changed** — and Christians are now called to **rest in Christ**, not just a day (Hebrews 4:9–10).
