## Short Answer:

- Some scientists say the universe is billions of years old, but many Christians believe the Bible points to a **young earth** (6,000–10,000 years).
    
- The age of the universe depends on **your starting point**: man’s assumptions or **God’s Word**.
    
- Ultimately, **what matters most is not the age of the earth—but the authority of Scripture**.

## What the Bible Says:

- **Created in Six Days:**
    
    - > _“For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth…”_ — Exodus 20:11
        
    - > _“There was evening and there was morning—the first day.”_ — Genesis 1:5  
        > The wording points to **literal, 24-hour days**.
        
- **Genealogies Give a Timeline:**
    
    - Genesis 5 and 11 contain **detailed genealogies** from Adam to Abraham.
        
    - These are **structured to be historical**, not symbolic, suggesting a timeline of **thousands, not billions, of years**.
        
- **God Created with Maturity:**
    
    - > _“God saw all that He had made, and it was very good.”_ — Genesis 1:31  
        > Just like Adam was created fully grown, **creation may have been made with the appearance of age**.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes radiometric dating, starlight distance, and fossil layers **must be interpreted without God**.
    
- Ignores that scientific dating methods rely on **assumptions** (e.g., constant decay rates, closed systems).
    
- Assumes Scripture must adjust to science, rather than science being interpreted through **a biblical lens**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Scientific Methods Are Based on Assumptions:**

- Radiometric dating assumes the original amount of material and no contamination.
    
- Different dating methods often give **contradictory results**.
    
- Many “old” things have been found with **carbon still present**—impossible if millions of years old.
    

### 2. **Distant Starlight Challenge:**

- Critics ask: _“How can we see stars millions of light-years away if the universe is young?”_  
    Possible biblical responses:
    
    - God **stretched out the heavens** supernaturally (Isaiah 40:22).
        
    - Light may have been created **in transit** to serve immediate purpose.
        
    - Time may function differently across space (Einstein’s theory of relativity opens the door to this).
        

### 3. **Young Earth Indicators:**

- Faint sun paradox, decaying magnetic field, helium in rocks, soft tissue in dinosaur bones.
    
- These all **challenge deep-time models** and align better with a **young earth worldview**.

## Encouragement:

- You don’t need to be a scientist to trust God's Word.
    
- > _“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge…”_ — Proverbs 1:7
    
- Many scientists, including geologists, astronomers, and biologists, **reject evolution and deep time**.
    
- You can stand confidently on a **young earth**, because **God was there**, and He told us what He did.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- The age of the earth is not just a science debate—it’s a **worldview issue**.
    
- **Who do you trust more?**
    
    - Scientists who weren’t there and who change their theories?
        
    - Or God who **was there** and gave His Word clearly?
        
- Jesus referenced Genesis as **real history**—not mythology.
    
    - > _“But from the beginning of creation, God ‘made them male and female.’”_ — Mark 10:6  
        > This means humans existed **from the beginning**, not billions of years later.
        
- The **billions-of-years model** introduces death, decay, and disease **before sin**, which contradicts the Gospel.

## Final Summary Answer:

- The universe **may appear old**, but God’s Word tells us He created it in **six literal days**, just **thousands of years ago**.
    
- The dating methods used by science are based on **assumptions**, not direct observation.
    
- You can trust the Bible’s timeline—because the God who made time also gave us His Word.
