## Short Answer:

- No — Christianity is **not copied** from ancient mythologies.
    
- Alleged similarities are either **false, exaggerated, or misunderstood**, and Jesus stands apart as a **real historical figure**.
    
- The Gospel is **unique** in content, time, purpose, and evidence.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“We did not follow cleverly devised myths… but were eyewitnesses of His majesty.”_ — 2 Peter 1:16
    
- > _“Many have undertaken to draw up an account… just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses…”_ — Luke 1:1–2
    
- > _“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We have seen His glory…”_ — John 1:14
    
- > _“Christ died for our sins… He was buried… He was raised on the third day… and He appeared…”_ — 1 Corinthians 15:3–5
    

The Bible itself **defends its historical grounding**, not myth-making.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes that **all religious stories are the same at their core**.
    
- Confuses **chronology with dependency** (just because something came earlier doesn’t mean it was copied).
    
- Often relies on **internet memes** or **outdated 19th-century scholarship**, not primary sources.
    
- Assumes Jesus' followers invented a myth for gain — yet they **died for their beliefs**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Claims of Similarities Are Exaggerated or False:**

#### Horus (Egypt):

- No record of Horus being **born of a virgin**, **crucified**, or **resurrected**.
    
- Born to **Isis and Osiris** (not virgin), died by **dismemberment**, not crucifixion.
    
- No ancient source shows Horus dying and rising like Jesus.
    

#### Mithras (Persia/Rome):

- Mithras was **born from a rock**, not a virgin.
    
- No death or resurrection in early Mithraic texts.
    
- Mithraism became popular **after Christianity**—not before.
    

#### Dionysus, Krishna, Attis, etc.:

- The “dying and rising god” theme is not consistent or clear in original sources.
    
- Most of these myths involve **cycles of seasons**, not historical claims of resurrection.
    
- Jesus' resurrection was **bodily, historical, and witnessed**—not symbolic.
    

### 2. **The Gospels Are Historical Documents:**

- Written within the **lifetime of eyewitnesses**.
    
- Include **verifiable names, locations, and details** (Luke 3:1–2).
    
- Backed by early **manuscript evidence**, archaeological consistency, and **non-Christian sources** (Josephus, Tacitus).
    

### 3. **Uniqueness of Jesus:**

- Jesus **forgives sin**, claims to be **God**, and offers salvation by **grace**—none of the pagan myths do this.
    
- The Gospel’s message is **countercultural** and doesn’t match the pattern of mythic hero tales.
    
- It involves **God sacrificing Himself** for sinners—not man earning divinity.

## Encouragement:

- You don’t have to fear the truth — **Jesus is not a myth**.  
    His life, death, and resurrection are the **most attested events in ancient history**.
    
- > _“You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”_ — John 8:32
    
- The claims of myth are **shallow and collapse under study**. You stand on solid ground.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- The “Jesus myth” theory is **rejected by nearly all serious historians**, even non-Christian ones.
    
- People like **Bart Ehrman** (atheist New Testament scholar) say Jesus definitely existed and was crucified — and these comparisons are **misleading**.
    
- Copycat claims often surface in **online documentaries (like _Zeitgeist_)**, but these are filled with **misquotes, false claims, and no real sources**.

## Final Summary Answer:

- Christianity was **not copied** from pagan myths like Horus or Mithras.
    
- The alleged parallels are **inaccurate, forced, or chronologically backward**.
    
- Jesus is **a unique, historical person**, whose life and resurrection are **unmatched by any mythology** — and **supported by real history, eyewitnesses, and evidence**.
