## Short Answer:

- Belief in God is not a crutch—it’s a response to truth.
    
- While faith offers comfort, it’s not based on wishful thinking but on **historical reality**, **rational evidence**, and a **deep human need for truth**, not illusion.

## What the Bible Says:

- **Faith Is Rooted in Truth, Not Delusion:**
    
    - > _“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”_ — Hebrews 11:1
        
    - > _“Come now, let us reason together…”_ — Isaiah 1:18
        
- **Christianity Is Based on Evidence:**
    
    - > _“This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses.”_ — Acts 2:32
        
    - > _“We did not follow cleverly devised myths… but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.”_ — 2 Peter 1:16
        
- **God Is Near to the Brokenhearted:**
    
    - > _“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.”_ — Psalm 34:18  
        > God does comfort—but that doesn’t mean He’s imaginary.
        

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes people only believe in God to **cope with fear**, **pain**, or **death**.
    
- Equates **comfort** with **falsehood** (which is a fallacy).
    
- Suggests that strong people don’t need God, while weak people do—ignoring the reality that even the strongest humans are still finite, mortal, and broken without Him.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

- **Logical Refutation:**
    
    - Saying belief in God is a crutch doesn’t address **whether it’s true**—only how someone feels about it.
        
        - Truth isn’t invalidated by comfort. A parachute brings comfort on a crashing plane—but that doesn’t make the parachute imaginary.
            
- **Historical Support:**
    
    - Christianity exploded not because it made people feel good—but because it was **true**, even when belief **cost them their lives**.
        
        - The disciples weren’t clinging to a fantasy. They were **tortured and killed**, not for what made them feel good—but for what they **saw and knew**.
            
- **Psychological Insight:**
    
    - The human mind seeks **meaning**, **justice**, and **hope**—and Christianity provides **coherent answers** to all.
        
    - Atheists also lean on psychological crutches: pride, autonomy, denial of judgment, or control.
        
        - Everyone leans on something. The question is: **is it strong enough to hold your weight?**

## Encouragement:

- God doesn’t want blind faith—He gives evidence, prophecy, history, and personal encounters.
    
- It’s okay to find **comfort** in God—that’s not weakness; that’s wisdom.
    
- > _“My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness.”_ — 2 Corinthians 12:9  
    > God isn’t a crutch—**He’s the foundation**.
    

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- **C.S. Lewis** (former atheist):
    
    > _“I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen—not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.”_
    
- Faith isn’t belief without evidence; it’s **trust in the One who’s proven faithful**.
    
- Everyone relies on something when life breaks down—relationships, substances, success, self-image.  
    God is the only one who **doesn’t break under the weight**.

## Final Summary Answer:

- Believing in God isn’t a crutch—it’s **trusting the truth**, even when it's hard.
    
- Christianity isn’t built on comfort—it’s built on **evidence**, **eyewitnesses**, **fulfilled prophecy**, and a risen Savior.
    
- We all lean on something. Only God is strong enough to carry the full weight of life, death, and eternity.
