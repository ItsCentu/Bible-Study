## Short Answer:

- God allowed forms of **servitude** in ancient times due to the fallen nature of society, but He **regulated**, **limited**, and **redeemed** it.
    
- Biblical “slavery” was **not the same as racial slavery** in modern history. God’s laws always moved people **toward justice, mercy, and freedom**, pointing forward to the **abolition of all slavery through Christ**.

## What the Bible Says:

### Old Testament (Regulated Bondservanthood):

- > _“If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free…”_ — Exodus 21:2  
    > Hebrew servitude was often **temporary**, more like indentured service due to debt.
    
- > _“Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God.”_ — Leviticus 25:43  
    > God **forbade abuse** and commanded kindness.
    
- > _“If a slave takes refuge with you, do not hand them over… Let them live among you wherever they like.”_ — Deuteronomy 23:15–16  
    > This shows **compassion and protection** for the vulnerable.

### New Testament (Transformed by the Gospel):

- > _“There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free… for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”_ — Galatians 3:28
    
- > _“Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly…”_ — Colossians 4:1  
    > Christianity planted the **seeds of abolition**—not by revolution, but by transformation of the heart.
    
- > _“If you can gain your freedom, do so.”_ — 1 Corinthians 7:21  
    > The Bible encourages **freedom whenever possible**.
## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes slavery in the Bible is the same as **racial, chattel slavery** (e.g., American slavery).
    
- Assumes God’s **allowance** equals **approval**.
    
- Forgets that God worked **within broken cultures** to move them toward truth, justice, and redemption over time.
## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Biblical “Slavery” Was Not Racial or Permanent:**

- Most servants in Israel were:
    
    - Paying off debt (like bankruptcy),
        
    - Captured in war (instead of being killed),
        
    - Or voluntarily serving for survival.
        
- Servants had **rights**, could own property, marry, and were to be treated **fairly and released**.

### 2. **Modern Slavery Was Condemned by Scripture:**

- > _“Whoever kidnaps a person… shall be put to death.”_ — Exodus 21:16  
    > Racial slavery based on kidnapping is **explicitly condemned** in God’s law.
### 3. **The Gospel Transformed Society From Within:**

- Early Christians, including Paul, never endorsed slavery as good—they **reoriented relationships** around love and equality in Christ.
    
- The early church was the first movement in history where **slaves and masters worshiped as equals**.
## Encouragement:

- God sees and defends the oppressed:
    
    > _“He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets prisoners free…”_ — Psalm 146:7
    
- Jesus came to **set the captives free**—physically, spiritually, and eternally (Luke 4:18).
    
- God worked through broken systems to bring about **healing, justice, and eventual freedom**.
## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- **God regulates, not endorses**—many things (like polygamy or divorce) were tolerated in Scripture due to human hardness, but never ideal.
    
- **Christianity led the world in ending slavery**:
    
    - William Wilberforce (UK),
        
    - Quakers (USA),
        
    - and many abolitionists were inspired by **biblical justice**.
        
- Critics often cherry-pick verses without understanding context, culture, and God's redemptive trajectory through Scripture.
## Final Summary Answer:

- God did not invent slavery—He **regulated and redeemed it** in a fallen world.
    
- The Bible’s version of servitude was **nothing like modern slavery**, and God's heart was always moving toward **justice and freedom**.
    
- Through Christ, slavery is not just abolished—it’s **replaced with unity, dignity, and love**.
