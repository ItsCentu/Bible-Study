## Short Answer:

- God creates people knowing some will reject Him because He values **genuine love and free will** over forced obedience.
    
- His foreknowledge does not make Him the cause of their rebellion—**He gives everyone a real choice**, and even those who reject Him serve a purpose in His greater plan of redemption.

## What the Bible Says:

- **God Knows All Things:**
    
    - > _“Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it completely.”_ — Psalm 139:4
        
    - > _“I make known the end from the beginning…”_ — Isaiah 46:10
        
- **God Gives Us Free Will:**
    
    - > _“Choose this day whom you will serve…”_ — Joshua 24:15
        
    - > _“I have set before you life and death… now choose life…”_ — Deuteronomy 30:19
        
- **God Is Patient Even with the Wicked:**
    
    - > _“The Lord is… patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.”_ — 2 Peter 3:9
        
- **Even the Rebellious Fulfill His Purpose:**
    
    - > _“The Scripture says to Pharaoh: ‘I raised you up for this very purpose… that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.’”_ — Romans 9:17

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes God creating someone = forcing their destiny.
    
- Assumes **foreknowledge equals predestination**, when the two are distinct.
    
- Overlooks the fact that love **requires real choice**, and God permits rebellion to preserve that freedom.
    
- Assumes that preventing rejection is more loving than permitting freedom.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

- **Logical Insight:**
    
    - God knowing a person will reject Him is not the same as God **causing** them to reject Him.
        
    - If God only created those who would love Him, it would make salvation **selective and robotic**, not personal and meaningful.
        
- **Moral Reasoning:**
    
    - A parent might have a child knowing that child could one day turn against them—but love still compels them to give life.
        
    - Real relationships must involve the risk of rejection.
        
- **Historical View:**
    
    - Many people who started by rejecting God later turned to Him (e.g., Paul, Augustine, countless former atheists).
        
    - God sees not only who people are now, but who they could become.

## Encouragement:

- Your life is not an accident—you were **created with purpose**, even knowing your struggles, doubts, or failures.
    
- God’s love is **so great** that He still chose to create you, pursue you, and offer salvation—**knowing everything about you**.
    
- > _“While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”_ — Romans 5:8  
    > He didn’t wait for perfection—He came for the broken.
    
## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- **Foreknowledge ≠ Force.**  
    Knowing someone’s future choices doesn’t mean you programmed them to make them.
    
- If God didn’t create people who might reject Him:
    
    - There would be no freedom.
        
    - No meaningful love.
        
    - No real moral responsibility.
        
- Even those who reject God serve to display His justice, mercy, and the weight of human choice.
    
- **C.S. Lewis** explained that in the end, there are only two kinds of people:
    
    > _“Those who say to God, ‘Thy will be done,’ and those to whom God says, ‘Thy will be done.’”_
    
## Final Summary Answer:

- God created people with the **freedom to choose**—even knowing some would reject Him—because love must be free to be real.
    
- His foreknowledge does not override their choice.
    
- He offers salvation to **all**, and even those who reject Him cannot stop His plan of redemption and glory.
    
- You were created intentionally—**and you’re still being pursued by the God who knew everything and loved you anyway**.
