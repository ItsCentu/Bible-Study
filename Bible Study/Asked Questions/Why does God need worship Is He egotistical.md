## Short Answer:

- God doesn’t need worship—**we do**.
    
- He commands worship not out of ego, but because worship **aligns our hearts with truth**, **transforms us**, and **honors the One who is truly worthy**.

## What the Bible Says:

- **God Is Complete Without Us:**
    
    - > _“The God who made the world… is not served by human hands, as if He needed anything.”_ — Acts 17:24–25
        
    - > _“Before the mountains were born… from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”_ — Psalm 90:2
        
- **God Desires Worship in Spirit and Truth:**
    
    - > _“The Father seeks those who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.”_ — John 4:23
        
- **Worship Is About Our Hearts:**
    
    - > _“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind.”_ — Matthew 22:37
        
- **God Alone Is Worthy:**
    
    - > _“Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power…”_ — Revelation 4:11

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes worship is about **feeding God's ego**, like a flawed human.
    
- Projects **human insecurity** or narcissism onto a perfect, eternal being.
    
- Forgets that **worship changes the worshiper**, not God.
    
- Assumes that commanding worship is the same as **needing** it.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

- **Logical Insight:**
    
    - If God is truly the **source of all life, beauty, love, and truth**, then **recognizing and responding to that is not ego—it’s reality.**
        
    - If we worship created things (money, fame, people), but not the Creator, we fall into **delusion** (Romans 1:21–25).
        
- **Psychological Evidence:**
    
    - Humans are **wired to worship**. We always give our time, attention, and value to something—what we worship shapes us.
        
    - Worship of God leads to **humility, peace, and transformation**; self-worship or idol worship leads to anxiety, pride, and destruction.
        
- **Historical Patterns:**
    
    - Cultures that abandoned God and truth often fell into **idolatry, moral decay, and collapse** (see Israel’s cycles in Judges, or empires like Rome).

## Encouragement:

- God doesn’t demand worship to **feel bigger**—He calls us to worship because it **restores us**.
    
- Worship lifts our eyes off ourselves and **reminds us who God is**: faithful, loving, powerful, and just.
    
- You were made for more than self-focus. You were made to know and glorify your Creator.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- **God is not like a prideful king demanding applause.** He is the **perfect, infinite Being**, and acknowledging His worth is not flattery—it’s truth.
    
- C.S. Lewis once thought God sounded egotistical—until he realized **worship is about joy completed**, not duty imposed.
    
    > _“We delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment.”_ — C.S. Lewis
    
- The question misunderstands **who God is**:
    
    - God doesn’t grow from worship.
        
    - We grow through worship.

## Final Summary Answer:

- God doesn’t need worship—we do.
    
- Worship isn't about boosting God's ego; it’s about putting truth in its rightful place.
    
- Worship reminds us **who God is**, and **who we are not**.
    
- In giving God glory, we find our peace, purpose, and place in the universe.
