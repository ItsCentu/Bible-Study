## Short Answer:

- God is **not male or female**—He is **Spirit** (John 4:24).
    
- The Bible refers to God as “He” because of **relational roles and revelation**, not because God is biologically male.
    
- God **values both men and women equally**—with distinct roles and equal worth.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”_ — John 4:24
    
- > _“So God created mankind in His own image… male and female He created them.”_ — Genesis 1:27
    
- > _“There is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”_ — Galatians 3:28
    
- > _“As a father has compassion… so the Lord has compassion…”_ — Psalm 103:13
    
- > _“As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you…”_ — Isaiah 66:13
    

Though God is referred to as “Father,” He also uses **maternal imagery** to describe His care and nature.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes that **language = hierarchy** (i.e., calling God “He” means men are superior).
    
- Assumes that describing God in masculine terms means He is **male in essence**.
    
- Often influenced by cultural pain or abuse of male authority.
    
- Misses the difference between **role and value**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **God Has No Biological Gender:**

- God doesn’t have a body (except in the Incarnation of Jesus).
    
- The use of “He” is **personal**, not **biological**.
    

### 2. **‘Father’ Shows Role, Not Superiority:**

- The title "Father" reflects **leadership, provision, protection**, and **intimacy**—not domination.
    
- Jesus taught us to pray “Our Father” to reveal a **relationship**, not a **power imbalance**.
    

### 3. **Women Are Equal in God’s Image:**

- In Genesis 1:27, both male and female are made **equally in God’s image**.
    
- Jesus uplifted women in a radically countercultural way:
    
    - Spoke to the Samaritan woman (John 4)
        
    - First appeared to women after His resurrection (Matthew 28:1–10)
        
    - Allowed women to learn at His feet (Luke 10:39)

## Encouragement:

- If you’ve been hurt by **misused authority**, know this:
    
    > God is not like fallen men.  
    > He is **perfectly just**, **tender**, and **protective**.
    
- God sees both men and women as **precious, necessary, and loved**.  
    No second-class citizens in His Kingdom.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Language for God is **analogical**—it helps us understand Him, but can’t fully capture Him.
    
- Calling God “He” doesn’t make Him male—it simply reflects how **He chose to reveal Himself** in history and relationship.
    
- The Bible never teaches that men are more valuable than women—only that **they have different roles** in family and church, which doesn’t imply inequality (see Jesus and the Trinity: same essence, different roles).

## Final Summary Answer:

- God is not male or female—He is **Spirit**.
    
- He’s called “He” not because of sexism, but because of how He’s **relationally revealed Himself** to us as Father.
    
- Scripture teaches that **men and women are equally made in God’s image**, equally valuable, and deeply loved.
