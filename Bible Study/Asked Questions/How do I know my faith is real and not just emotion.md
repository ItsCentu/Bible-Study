## Short Answer:

- Real faith is **rooted in truth**, not just feelings.
    
- It's revealed by **trust in Jesus**, ongoing **transformation**, **obedience**, and **perseverance** — not emotional highs or momentary inspiration.
    
- Emotions can **support** faith, but they don’t **sustain** it.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves.”_ — 2 Corinthians 13:5
    
- > _“Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.”_ — Romans 10:17
    
- > _“The heart is deceitful above all things…”_ — Jeremiah 17:9
    
- > _“The one who stands firm to the end will be saved.”_ — Matthew 24:13
    
- > _“You will know them by their fruits.”_ — Matthew 7:16

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes faith must always “feel” strong or emotional to be real.
    
- Confuses **emotional experience** with **spiritual transformation**.
    
- May stem from insecurity, spiritual attacks, or lack of discipleship.
    
- Often fueled by the **ups and downs of life or mood**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Real Faith Is Based on Truth, Not Feeling:**

- Faith comes by hearing **God’s Word**, not by emotional worship or good vibes (Romans 10:17).
    
- Jesus never said, “Feel deeply”—He said, _“Follow Me.”_
    

### 2. **Evidence of True Faith Is Growth Over Time:**

- Do you:
    
    - Hate your sin more over time?
        
    - Desire to know God better?
        
    - Trust Christ in hardship, even when you don’t feel it?  
        → That’s the fruit of **real faith**.
        
- Emotions are **temporary**. Obedience and repentance are signs of the **Spirit’s work**.
    

### 3. **Faith That Endures Is Faith That Is Real:**

- Even when you're dry, doubting, or discouraged, you keep turning to Jesus.
    
- That’s not fake faith — that’s **tested faith** (1 Peter 1:6–7).
    
- Real faith sometimes **wrestles**, but it always **returns to Christ**.

## Encouragement:

- If you’re worried your faith is fake, that’s a **good sign** — it shows you **care** and you’re seeking truth.
    
- > _“A bruised reed He will not break…”_ — Isaiah 42:3
    
- God isn’t asking for perfect faith—just **sincere trust** in the Perfect Savior.
    
- Don’t measure your faith by your emotions. Measure it by your **dependence on Jesus**, even when it’s hard.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Feelings **come and go**. Truth doesn’t.
    
- If faith were only emotion, Christianity would crumble under trials — but instead, it **thrives in persecution**, suffering, and silence.
    
- Historical Christianity is grounded in evidence (the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus), not fleeting feelings.
    
- Countless believers have **no emotional high**, but still walk faithfully for decades. That’s not emotion—that’s **real, anchored faith**.

## Final Summary Answer:

- True faith is **anchored in the truth of God’s Word and the person of Jesus**, not in feelings.
    
- It shows itself through **repentance, obedience, and endurance**, not just passion.
    
- Emotions fade, but **real faith follows Christ**, even when it’s hard — and that’s the kind God will **never let go of**.
