## Short Answer:

- Homosexual behavior is called a sin in the Bible because it goes against God’s **design for sexuality and marriage**, which is one man and one woman in covenant relationship.
    
- Like all sexual sin, it reflects a departure from God’s **created order**, but it is not **unforgivable**—God offers **grace, truth, and transformation** to all.

## What the Bible Says:

### Old Testament:

- > _“Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.”_ — Leviticus 18:22
    
- > _“They exchanged their glory for the shame of their own bodies…”_ — Genesis 19 (Sodom and Gomorrah)  
    > Homosexual acts are listed among other sexual sins, all of which violate God's holiness.
    

### New Testament:

- > _“Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts… men committed shameful acts with other men…”_ — Romans 1:26–27
    
- > _“Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral… nor men who have sex with men… will inherit the kingdom of God.”_ — 1 Corinthians 6:9–10
    
- > _“But you were washed, you were sanctified…”_ — 1 Corinthians 6:11  
    > Paul emphasizes **redemption**—not condemnation alone.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes that if someone has a desire, acting on it must be okay.
    
- Assumes calling something a sin equals **hatred** or **bigotry**.
    
- Often influenced by culture, emotion, or personal experiences rather than **biblical standards**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

###  1. **God Designed Sex With Purpose:**

- In Genesis 1–2, God creates **male and female** with complementary bodies and roles.
    
- Marriage reflects Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:31–32)—something **only possible between man and woman**.
    

### 2. **Desire ≠ Identity:**

- Feelings do not define us—**God does**.
    
- All people have **sinful desires**, whether sexual, selfish, or prideful—but we’re called to **surrender them** to Christ.
    

### 3. **Not the Only Sexual Sin:**

- The Bible also calls out:
    
    - Adultery
        
    - Premarital sex
        
    - Lust
        
    - Pornography
        
    - Incest
        
    - Bestiality
        
- God's standard is not singling anyone out—it applies to **everyone**.

## Encouragement:

- God’s design is not about restriction—it’s about **flourishing**.
    
- Every person—gay or straight—is loved by God and invited into **relationship, healing, and truth**.
    
- > _“If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”_ — John 8:36
    
- > _“There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.”_ — Romans 8:1

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- **Truth and love are not enemies**—we are called to speak **both** (Ephesians 4:15).
    
- Telling someone the truth about sin is **not hate**—it’s **hope**, when it’s paired with grace.
    
- Jesus welcomed sinners—but He also said:
    
    > _“Go and sin no more.”_ — John 8:11
    
- The early church was full of **transformed lives**, including those who had once practiced sexual sin (1 Corinthians 6:11).

## Final Summary Answer:

- Homosexuality is called a sin in the Bible because it **contradicts God’s design** for sex and marriage.
    
- Like all sin, it separates us from God—but **does not disqualify anyone** from His love or salvation.
    
- In Christ, there is **truth, grace, forgiveness, and transformation** for everyone willing to surrender and follow Him.
