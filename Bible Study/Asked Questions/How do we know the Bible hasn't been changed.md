## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

- **Manuscript Evidence:**
    
    - Over **5,800+ Greek manuscripts** of the New Testament.
        
    - Over **19,000+ copies in other languages** (Latin, Coptic, Syriac, etc.).
        
    - Some manuscripts date back to **within 50–100 years of the original writings**—far better than any other ancient text.
        
- **Dead Sea Scrolls:**
    
    - Discovered in 1947, dating back to **200 B.C.**
        
    - Contain Old Testament books nearly **identical** to modern copies.
        
    - Proves the Old Testament was preserved **accurately over 2,000 years**.
        
- **Textual Criticism:**
    
    - Scholars compare manuscripts to detect variations.
        
    - Over **99.5% of the Bible** is textually certain.
        
    - The **0.5% of variations** are minor (spelling, word order) and do **not affect any core doctrine**.
        
- **Historical Continuity:**
    
    - Early church fathers **quoted the New Testament** so often that we could reconstruct almost the entire text just from their writings (before 300 A.D.).
