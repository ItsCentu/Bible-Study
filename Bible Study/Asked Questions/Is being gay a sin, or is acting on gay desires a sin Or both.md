# Short Answer:
- **Having same-sex attraction (being gay)** is not a sin in itself — temptation is not sin.
    
- **Acting on those desires** through lustful thoughts or sexual behavior is what Scripture defines as sin.
    
- God calls all people — regardless of temptation — to a life of **sexual holiness and self-control**.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“Each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin…”_ — James 1:14–15
    
- > _“Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral… nor men who practice homosexuality… will inherit the kingdom of God.”_ — 1 Corinthians 6:9–10
    
- > _“Honor God with your bodies.”_ — 1 Corinthians 6:20
    
- > _“We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.”_ — Hebrews 4:15
    
- > _“God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance.”_ — Romans 2:4

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Confusion between **temptation and sin**.
    
- Pressure from culture to equate **identity with behavior**.
    
- The belief that if a desire is **natural**, it must be **moral**.
    
- Misuse of verses like “God is love” to excuse what God also calls sin.
    
- Desire to reconcile personal feelings or the struggles of loved ones with faith.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Temptation Is Not Sin:**

- Jesus Himself was tempted (Hebrews 4:15), yet was without sin.
    
- Having an unwanted attraction or impulse is **not inherently sinful** — what we **do** with it matters.
    

### 2. **The Bible Consistently Condemns Same-Sex _Behavior_, Not Identity:**

- Romans 1:26–27, 1 Corinthians 6:9, and Leviticus 18:22 speak against **acting on** same-sex desires.
    
- The word used in 1 Cor 6:9 ("arsenokoitai") refers specifically to **male-male sexual relations**, not orientation or friendship.
    

### 3. **We All Have Fallen Desires:**

- Heterosexuals are tempted toward lust, porn, adultery, etc.
    
- Homosexual attraction is one of many temptations humanity may face.
    
- The call to **sexual purity** applies to **everyone**, regardless of the type of temptation.

## Encouragement:

- Struggling with temptation is not a sign of failure — it’s a sign you’re **in the fight**.
    
- Many faithful Christians experience same-sex attraction but choose to live in **obedience to Christ**.
    
- > _“My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness.”_ — 2 Corinthians 12:9
    
- You are **not alone**, and God offers **forgiveness, strength, and identity** in Him — not in your desires.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Critics may say, “Jesus never talked about homosexuality.”  
    → But He affirmed **God’s design for marriage** in Matthew 19:4–6 — one man and one woman.
    
- Others say, “But I was born this way.”  
    → We’re all born with **sinful tendencies** (Psalm 51:5). That’s why Jesus says we must be **born again** (John 3:3).
    
- Christianity doesn’t single out same-sex sin — it calls **everyone** to die to their flesh and follow Jesus (Luke 9:23).

## Final Summary Answer:

- **Being gay (experiencing same-sex attraction)** is not sin in itself — **acting on it** through lust or sexual behavior is.
    
- God calls all believers to **deny themselves**, regardless of orientation, and pursue **holiness** through Christ.
    
- No matter the temptation, there is **forgiveness, identity, and purpose** in Jesus.
