## Short Answer:

- They’re **deeply connected**, but **not exactly the same**.
    
- **Greed** is the _desire to have more_, especially what doesn’t belong to you.
    
- **Love of money** is **idolatry** — putting **trust and value** in wealth instead of God.
    
- Greed is a **symptom**; love of money is the **root**.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“You cannot serve both God and money.”_ — Matthew 6:24
    
- > _“The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.”_ — 1 Timothy 6:10
    
- > _“Put to death… greed, which is idolatry.”_ — Colossians 3:5
    
- > _“You shall not covet…”_ — Exodus 20:17
    
- > _“Keep your life free from the love of money, and be content with what you have…”_ — Hebrews 13:5

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Greed = “I want more”
    
- Love of money = “I **need** more to feel secure or successful”
    
- Many assume that **both mean selfishness**, but one is **desire**, the other is **dependence**

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Greed Is About Taking; Love of Money Is About Trusting:**

- Greed pushes a person to **take more** — it’s action-based.
    
- Love of money causes people to **depend on wealth** — it’s worship-based.
    

### 2. **Greed Is Sinful Desire; Love of Money Is Replacing God:**

- Greed says: _“I want what’s not mine.”_
    
- Love of money says: _“Money is what gives me hope, identity, or safety.”_
    

### 3. **One Leads to the Other:**

- A greedy heart can **turn into** idolatry (loving money more than God).
    
- Both distort how we treat people, use resources, and view success.

## Encouragement:

- God doesn’t just want to remove greed — He wants to **replace it with contentment**.
    
- > _“Godliness with contentment is great gain.”_ — 1 Timothy 6:6
    
- In Christ, you’re already **rich in grace, hope, and purpose** — far better than any wealth.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Critics might say, “Is money evil then?”  
    → No — money is neutral. It’s the **love of money** that’s the root of evil.  
    → Abraham, Job, and Solomon were wealthy — but **trusted God**, not riches.
    
- Others say, “It’s just ambition.”  
    → There’s a difference between **working hard** and **worshiping wealth**.  
    → God blesses diligence — not greed or idolizing success.

## Final Summary Answer:

- Greed and the love of money are closely connected, but **not identical**.
    
- Greed is the **desire for more**; love of money is **trusting in wealth over God** — which makes it idolatry.
    
- Both are dangerous, but the love of money is deeper — it replaces God in your heart.
