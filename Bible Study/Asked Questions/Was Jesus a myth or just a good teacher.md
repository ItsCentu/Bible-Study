## Short Answer:

- Jesus was **not a myth**, nor merely a “good teacher.”
    
- He was a **real historical person** who **claimed to be God**, performed miracles, fulfilled prophecy, and **rose from the dead**.
    
- You can’t honestly call Him just a teacher — His claims **demand a decision**.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We have seen His glory…”_ — John 1:14
    
- > _“I and the Father are one.”_ — John 10:30
    
- > _“No one comes to the Father except through Me.”_ — John 14:6
    
- > _“You killed the Author of life, but God raised Him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.”_ — Acts 3:15
    
- > _“We did not follow cleverly invented stories… but we were eyewitnesses…”_ — 2 Peter 1:16

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes miraculous claims are impossible, so Jesus must be mythical or symbolic.
    
- Tries to reduce Jesus to a **safe, moral teacher**, avoiding the weight of His divine claims.
    
- Influenced by **skepticism of miracles**, **online myths**, or secularized portrayals of religion.
    
- Ignores the **mountains of historical evidence and eyewitness testimony**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Jesus Was a Real Historical Person:**

- Confirmed by **non-Christian sources**:
    
    - **Josephus** (Jewish historian): Mentions Jesus, His crucifixion, and resurrection claims.
        
    - **Tacitus** (Roman historian): Confirms Jesus’ execution under Pontius Pilate.
        
    - **Pliny the Younger**, **Lucian**, **Suetonius**, and others also mention Him.
        
- No serious historian (even atheist ones like **Bart Ehrman**) believes Jesus was a myth.  
    → The “Jesus Myth” theory is fringe and discredited.
    

### 2. **Jesus Made Radical Claims About Himself:**

- He claimed to be:
    
    - The **Son of God** (John 5:18)
        
    - Equal with the Father (John 10:30)
        
    - The **only way to salvation** (John 14:6)
        
    - Able to **forgive sins** (Mark 2:5–7)
        
    - Lord over the Sabbath (Luke 6:5)
        

→ **No “good teacher” would say these things unless they were true.**

> **C.S. Lewis’ famous trilemma:**  
> _“Jesus is either a Liar, a Lunatic, or the Lord.”_

### 3. **The Resurrection Sets Him Apart:**

- Empty tomb, multiple eyewitnesses, radical transformation of disciples.
    
- Early creeds (like 1 Corinthians 15:3–5) date **within 5 years** of the resurrection.
    
- Thousands converted immediately **despite persecution and death threats** — not for myth, but for **truth they saw**.

## Encouragement:

- You’re not following a legend — you’re trusting a **living Savior**, proven in history and in changed lives.
    
- > _“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.”_ — Hebrews 13:8
    
- You can be confident that your faith is **rooted in reality**, not religious fantasy.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- If Jesus was only a good teacher, why was He **killed as a blasphemer**?  
    Why did His disciples **willingly die** rather than deny Him?
    
- Mythical figures don’t appear in detailed **historical settings** (named rulers, places, timelines — Luke 3:1–2).
    
- Other "moral teachers" (Socrates, Confucius) never claimed to be God — but **Jesus did**.
    
- You **can’t logically reduce** Jesus to a teacher without ignoring **what He actually said and did**.

## Final Summary Answer:

- Jesus is **not a myth**, nor just a good man.
    
- He is a **real, historical person** who claimed to be **God in the flesh**, died, and rose again.
    
- You must decide: **Was He lying, crazy — or is He Lord?**
