## Short Answer:

- God is **not different**—He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
    
- The Old and New Testaments reveal **different aspects** of the same God: His **justice and holiness** (OT) and His **mercy and love through Christ** (NT). Together, they show a **complete picture** of His character.

## What the Bible Says:

- **God Never Changes:**
    
    - > _“I the Lord do not change.”_ — Malachi 3:6
        
    - > _“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.”_ — Hebrews 13:8
        
- **God's Justice and Mercy Are Consistent:**
    
    - > _“The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.”_ — Psalm 103:8 (Old Testament)
        
    - > _“It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.”_ — Hebrews 10:31 (New Testament)
        
- **God’s Character Is Fully Revealed in Christ:**
    
    - > _“Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father.”_ — John 14:9  
        > Jesus is not a “new version” of God—He is the **exact representation** (Hebrews 1:3).
        

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes the Old Testament God is **harsh and angry**, and the New Testament God is **kind and forgiving**.
    
- Misunderstands the purpose of **judgment, law, and sacrifice** in the OT.
    
- Overlooks the **judgment and seriousness of sin** in the New Testament (e.g., Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5, Revelation’s judgments).
    
- Fails to see the **grace and patience** already present in the Old Testament.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### Old Testament Grace:

- God gave the wicked Canaanites **over 400 years to repent** (Genesis 15:16).
    
- He spared **Nineveh**, Israel’s enemy, when they repented (Jonah 3).
    
- He constantly sent prophets to call people to **mercy, not destruction**.
    

### New Testament Judgment:

- Jesus talked about **Hell more than anyone else** in Scripture.
    
- God’s judgment still exists—seen in Acts 5 (sudden death for lying), and the coming wrath in Revelation.
    

### Unified Character:

- **Same God**, two testaments:
    
    - In the OT, we see **God the Judge**, preparing the way for salvation.
        
    - In the NT, we see **God the Savior**, fulfilling the law through Jesus.
        
- Like a **diamond**, God’s nature has **many facets**—justice, mercy, patience, wrath, love, holiness, and truth—all consistent.

## Encouragement:

- God’s justice shows that **evil will not win**. His mercy shows that **you don’t have to be perfect** to be loved.
    
- > _“The Lord is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.”_ — Psalm 116:5
    
- The same God who judged Egypt also rescued Israel. The same God who gave the Law also sent Jesus to fulfill it.
    
- He’s not different. He’s **complete**.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- The supposed “two gods” theory (OT = angry, NT = loving) comes from **surface-level reading**.
    
- **Marcion**, a heretic in the 2nd century, tried to reject the OT God—he was rightly condemned by the early church.
    
- Jesus quoted the OT constantly, fulfilled its prophecies, and never dismissed it—in fact, He said:
    
    - > _“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.”_ — Matthew 5:17
        
- **God’s wrath** in the OT is His response to sin.  
    **Jesus’ death** in the NT is also a response to sin—but through substitution and grace.

## Final Summary Answer:

- God is not different between the Old and New Testaments.
    
- The OT shows His **holiness, justice, and preparation** for redemption.
    
- The NT reveals His **grace, love, and fulfillment** through Jesus.
    
- It’s one God, one plan, one story—from Genesis to Revelation. You can trust His heart **never changes**.
