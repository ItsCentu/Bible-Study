## Short Answer:

- God **couldn’t “just forgive”** without justice being satisfied—because He is not only loving, but **perfectly just**.
    
- Jesus died to satisfy the **justice of God** and to offer **grace and mercy** without compromising God’s holiness.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.”_ — Hebrews 9:22
    
- > _“God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement… to demonstrate His justice.”_ — Romans 3:25–26
    
- > _“The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life…”_ — Romans 6:23
    
- > _“He was pierced for our transgressions… and by His wounds we are healed.”_ — Isaiah 53:5
    
- > _“For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God.”_ — 1 Peter 3:18
    

Jesus’ death **wasn’t optional**—it was the only way to uphold both **justice and mercy**.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes forgiveness can be given without cost.
    
- Assumes God’s love overrides His justice.
    
- Overlooks the **seriousness of sin** and the **holiness of God**.
    
- Compares divine forgiveness to casual human apologies.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Real Justice Requires Payment:**

- If a judge simply lets a criminal go free without punishment, we call it **corruption**, not mercy.
    
- Forgiveness always **costs something**—it’s never free.  
    In God’s case, **He paid the price Himself** through Jesus.
    

### 2. **Jesus Took Our Place:**

- He was **fully God** (able to pay the infinite debt) and **fully man** (able to represent us).
    
- Only Jesus could satisfy the demands of justice **and** extend mercy.
    
- > _“God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us…”_ — 2 Corinthians 5:21
    

### 3. **The Cross Shows Both Justice and Love:**

- At the cross, God said:
    
    - “Sin is so serious, it must be punished.”
        
    - “I love you so much, I’ll take the punishment Myself.”
        
- No other religion offers a God who is both **just and merciful** at once.

## Encouragement:

- Jesus didn’t die to _make_ God love you—He died **because God already does** (John 3:16).
    
- Your sin is serious—but **His grace is greater**.
    
- > _“There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.”_ — Romans 8:1
    
- He paid what we never could—so we could walk free.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Critics say, “Why can’t God just forgive?” — But they misunderstand what **forgiveness costs**.
    
    - Forgiveness **isn’t ignoring sin**, it’s absorbing the cost.
        
- Only the cross solves the divine dilemma:
    
    - **How can God remain just while justifying sinners?**
        
    - > _“So that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.”_ — Romans 3:26
        
- The cross is **not divine child abuse**—Jesus **willingly laid down His life** (John 10:18) in perfect unity with the Father.

## Final Summary Answer:

- Jesus had to die because sin demands justice, and God cannot ignore it without compromising His holiness.
    
- Only Jesus—fully God and fully man—could take our place, satisfy justice, and offer forgiveness.
    
- The cross is where **justice and mercy meet**, and where **love is fully revealed**.
