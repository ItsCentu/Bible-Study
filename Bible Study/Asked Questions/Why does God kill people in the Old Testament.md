## Short Answer:

- God is perfectly just and holy—He judges evil not out of cruelty, but because of righteousness. In the Old Testament, God's actions often served as judgment, protection, or fulfillment of a greater purpose. His justice is never separated from His mercy.

## What the Bible Says:

- **God Is Just and Holy:**
    
    - > _“The Lord is righteous in all His ways and faithful in all He does.”_ — Psalm 145:17
        
    - > _“The soul who sins is the one who will die.”_ — Ezekiel 18:20
        
- **Judgment for Extreme Wickedness:**
    
    - > _“The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full…”_ — Genesis 15:16  
        > (God gave Canaanites over 400 years to repent before judgment.)
        
- **God Is Patient Before Judgment:**
    
    - > _“Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? ... Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?”_ — Ezekiel 18:23
        
- **He Judges Entire Nations When Necessary:**
    
    - The **Flood** (Genesis 6–9): Global corruption and violence.
        
    - **Sodom and Gomorrah** (Genesis 18–19): Extreme immorality.
        
    - **Canaanites** (Deuteronomy 9:5): Idolatry, child sacrifice, bestiality.
        
- **God Still Shows Mercy Even in Judgment:**
    
    - He spared **Nineveh** when they repented (Jonah 3).
        
    - He spared **Rahab** from Jericho (Joshua 2).
        
    - He delayed judgment for generations (Genesis 15:16).

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes that death is the **worst possible thing**—but biblically, spiritual death is worse.
    
- Assumes **humans are morally innocent** and don’t deserve judgment.
    
- Assumes **God must act according to human standards** of morality.
    
- Often rooted in discomfort with authority, justice, and the idea of absolute truth.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

- **Historical Context:**
    
    - Many of the civilizations God judged (like the Canaanites) practiced **ritual child sacrifice**, **rape cults**, and **violent conquest**.
        
    - God's commands were not genocide—they were **judgments** after long periods of warning and evil.
        
- **Logical Insight:**
    
    - A judge who doesn’t punish murder, rape, or abuse isn’t loving—he’s corrupt.
        
    - God, as a perfect judge, knows every heart, every act, and every intent. He never overreacts.
        
- **Scientific Morality:**
    
    - Even secular societies agree that some actions (e.g., child sacrifice) deserve severe consequences.
        
    - The Bible shows God as patient—but not passive.

## Encouragement:

- God’s justice **proves** He is good. He doesn’t ignore evil—He deals with it.
    
- His mercy is **greater than His wrath**—every judgment came **after warnings**, **prophets**, and **opportunities to repent**.
    
- God is the same yesterday and today: **just**, but also **full of mercy** (Malachi 3:6, Hebrews 13:8).

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- **Atheists** often highlight these passages without understanding context.
    
- **Old Testament judgment** must be seen in light of:
    
    - God’s holiness.
        
    - Humanity’s rebellion.
        
    - God's long-term redemptive plan through Israel and ultimately, Jesus.
        
- **Moral Comparison:**  
    If we punish criminals today, how much more is God—who sees every heart—just in His judgments?
    
- **Christ Is the Full Picture:**  
    Jesus didn’t erase the God of the Old Testament—He fulfilled His plan of justice and mercy at the cross.

## Final Summary Answer:

- God kills in the Old Testament as an act of **justice**, **judgment**, and sometimes **mercy**.
    
- These events reflect His holiness and intolerance of evil—not random cruelty.
    
- Every judgment came after warning, patience, and opportunity.
    
- God’s justice in the Old shows us the **seriousness of sin**—and His love in sending Jesus shows us the **depth of His mercy**.
