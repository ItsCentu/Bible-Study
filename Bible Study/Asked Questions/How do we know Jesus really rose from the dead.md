## Short Answer:

- We know Jesus rose from the dead through **eyewitness testimony**, **historical evidence**, and the **transformation** of His followers.
    
- The resurrection is one of the **best-attested events in ancient history**, and it confirms that Jesus is truly the Son of God.

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“He is not here; He has risen, just as He said.”_ — Matthew 28:6
    
- > _“Christ died for our sins… He was buried… He was raised on the third day… and He appeared to more than 500 people at once.”_ — 1 Corinthians 15:3–6
    
- > _“If Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.”_ — 1 Corinthians 15:14
    
- > _“With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.”_ — Acts 4:33

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes miracles are impossible (naturalism bias).
    
- Assumes ancient people were gullible or mistaken.
    
- Assumes the resurrection is a legend, myth, or hallucination.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Eyewitness Testimony:**

- Jesus appeared **physically and publicly** to:
    
    - Mary Magdalene (John 20:14–17)
        
    - The disciples (Luke 24:36–43)
        
    - More than 500 people at once (1 Corinthians 15:6)
        
- These were not vague visions—He **ate**, **spoke**, and **showed His wounds**.
    

### 2. **The Empty Tomb:**

- Even Jesus’ **enemies admitted** the tomb was empty (Matthew 28:11–15).
    
- If the body had been stolen or misplaced, Christianity would’ve been **instantly disproven**.
    
- The tomb was guarded by Roman soldiers (Matthew 27:65–66).
    

### 3. **The Disciples Were Transformed:**

- Cowards became martyrs.  
    They didn’t die for a metaphor—they died proclaiming a **physical resurrection**.
    
- Liars don’t suffer torture and death for something they **know is false**.
    

### 4. **The Explosion of the Early Church:**

- Christianity spread **rapidly** through hostile territory.
    
- Jews who believed in strict monotheism suddenly began **worshiping Jesus** as God.  
    Something **radical and real** happened.
    

### 5. **Alternative Explanations Fail:**

- **Hallucination theory:** Doesn’t explain group appearances.
    
- **Stolen body theory:** The disciples had **no motive, no means**, and died **claiming the opposite**.
    
- **Swoon theory:** Roman execution was **brutal and final**. Jesus was **dead**—even pierced through His side (John 19:34).

## Encouragement:

- The resurrection proves that **death has been defeated**.
    
- > _“Because I live, you also will live.”_ — John 14:19
    
- Jesus rose to **give us eternal life, victory, and hope**.  
    Our faith isn’t blind—it’s built on a **real, historical resurrection**.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Virtually all historians—Christian or not—agree that:
    
    - Jesus died by crucifixion.
        
    - His tomb was empty.
        
    - His disciples believed they saw Him alive again.
        
- The question is: **what best explains the facts?**  
    → The **resurrection** is the most logical and consistent answer.
    
- > _“If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile…”_ — 1 Corinthians 15:17  
    > But the tomb **was empty**—and history changed forever.

## Final Summary Answer:

- We know Jesus rose from the dead because of **eyewitnesses**, **the empty tomb**, and the **radical transformation** of His followers.
    
- All alternative theories fall short. The resurrection is not just a **hopeful idea**—it’s a **historical event**.
    
- Because He lives, we have **assurance of forgiveness, salvation, and eternal life**.
