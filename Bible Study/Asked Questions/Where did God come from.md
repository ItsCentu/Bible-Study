## Short Answer:

- God **didn’t come from anywhere**—He has **always existed**.
    
- Unlike everything in creation, God is **eternal, uncreated, and outside of time**. Asking “where” or “when” God began is a category mistake, because He is **the beginning** of everything else.

## What the Bible Says:

- **God Is Eternal:**
    
    - > _“From everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”_ — Psalm 90:2
        
    - > _“I am the Alpha and the Omega… who is, and who was, and who is to come.”_ — Revelation 1:8
        
- **God Has No Origin:**
    
    - > _“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”_ — Genesis 1:1  
        > He was already there **before** time and space began.
        
- **He Exists Independently:**
    
    - > _“I AM WHO I AM.”_ — Exodus 3:14  
        > God's name itself reveals **self-existence**, with no beginning and no end.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes that **everything** must have a cause or origin—but that only applies to **created things**.
    
- Applies the laws of the universe (like time and causality) to **God, who exists outside them**.
    
- Treats God like a created object, rather than the **uncreated Creator**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

### 1. **Law of Causality Applies to Created Things:**

- Everything **with a beginning** needs a cause.
    
- But God **has no beginning**—so He doesn’t need a cause.  
    This is called being **necessary**, not contingent.
    

### 2. **Philosophical Clarity:**

- There must be a **first uncaused cause** behind all things.
    
- Infinite regress (an endless chain of causes) is **logically impossible**—so something must be **eternal**.
    
- That **eternal being** is what we call **God**.
    

### 3. **Science Confirms a Beginning:**

- The universe had a starting point (Big Bang theory, 2nd Law of Thermodynamics).
    
- If time, space, and matter had a beginning—then the cause must be:
    
    - **Timeless**
        
    - **Spaceless**
        
    - **Immaterial**
        
    - **Powerful**
        
    - **Intelligent**  
        —which matches the **biblical description of God**.

## Encouragement:

- God is not like us—and that’s a good thing. He’s not limited, bound, or caused.
    
- > _“The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.”_ — Deuteronomy 33:27
    
- Because God is **eternal**, **unchanging**, and **sovereign**, you can trust Him **completely**—He’s not going anywhere.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Atheists may ask, “Who made God?” but this misunderstands the definition of **God**.
    
- By definition, **God is the uncreated Creator**—if He were created, He wouldn’t be God.
    
- This is like asking, _“What does blue smell like?”_—it’s a **category error**.
    
- The real question isn’t “Where did God come from?” but **“Why is there anything at all?”**
    
- Only a timeless, necessary being explains the **existence of everything else**.

## Final Summary Answer:

- God has **no beginning and no cause**—He is the **eternal, self-existent Creator** who exists outside of time and space.
    
- The question “Where did God come from?” doesn’t apply to Him—He **is** the origin of all things.
    
- You can trust Him as the **unchanging Rock** who has always been—and always will be.
