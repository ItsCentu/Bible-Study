## Short Answer:

- God allows evil and suffering for a time to fulfill a greater purpose—free will, growth, justice, and redemption.
    
- He is not absent; He is patient, working toward an eternal plan that will one day remove all evil forever.

## What the Bible Says:

- **Free Will and the Fall:**
    
    - God gave humanity choice (Genesis 2:16–17), and through that freedom, sin entered the world (Genesis 3).
        
    - Suffering is a result of sin and brokenness—not God’s original design.
        
- **God’s Patience and Mercy:**
    
    - > _“The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise… Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.”_ — 2 Peter 3:9
        
- **Suffering Can Have Purpose:**
    
    - > _“Suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.”_ — Romans 5:3–4
        
- **God Will End All Evil:**
    
    - > _“He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain…”_ — Revelation 21:4

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- The assumption that a good God would eliminate evil immediately.
    
- The belief that suffering has no higher purpose.
    
- The idea that God's goodness and the existence of evil can't coexist.
    
- The role of:
    
    - Human free will.
        
    - Satanic influence (John 10:10).
        
    - A fallen world (Romans 8:20–22).

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

- **Logical Reasoning:**
    
    - Free will must allow for the possibility of evil. Otherwise, love and obedience would be forced.
        
- **Historical:**
    
    - Christians throughout history (e.g., early church, martyrs) endured immense suffering while maintaining faith and joy.
        
- **Scientific:**
    
    - Pain responses in the body serve as warning systems (e.g., touching fire teaches avoidance of danger).
        
    - Emotional pain can lead to maturity, empathy, and deeper wisdom.

## Encouragement:

- Many biblical figures wrestled with suffering (Job, David, Jeremiah, Paul, even Jesus).
    
- > _“Jesus wept.”_ — John 11:35  
    > God is not distant—He feels our pain.
    
- > _“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him…”_ — Romans 8:28

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- The existence of **evil** actually supports the **existence of God**:
    
    - If evil exists, then good must exist.
        
    - If good exists, there must be a moral law.
        
    - If there is moral law, there must be a moral lawgiver.
        
- Atheism often struggles to define **objective evil**; Christianity explains both its origin and its solution.
    
- **Jesus Christ** is the greatest apologetic:
    
    - God took on human flesh.
        
    - He experienced the worst suffering.
        
    - He conquered evil through the cross and resurrection.

## Final Summary Answer:

- God does not ignore evil or suffering—He permits them temporarily for the sake of love, choice, and ultimate redemption.
    
- Through Jesus, He entered our broken world and offered healing, hope, and a future where suffering will be no more.
    
- Evil will not last forever, but God's justice and mercy will.
