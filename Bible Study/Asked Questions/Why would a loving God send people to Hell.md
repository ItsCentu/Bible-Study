## Short Answer:

- God doesn’t send people to Hell against their will—He honors their choice to reject Him. Hell is not a contradiction of His love; it is the result of His justice when people freely choose separation from Him.

## What the Bible Says:

- **God Desires All to Be Saved:**
    
    - > _“[God] is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.”_ — 2 Peter 3:9
        
    - > _“[God] wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.”_ — 1 Timothy 2:4
        
- **God Gives People a Choice:**
    
    - > _“I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life…”_ — Deuteronomy 30:19
        
    - > _“This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light…”_ — John 3:19
        
- **Hell is Real and Just:**
    
    - > _“Then He will say… ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.’”_ — Matthew 25:41
        
    - > _“They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord…”_ — 2 Thessalonians 1:9

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Assumes God’s love should override His justice.
    
- Assumes people are innocent and don’t deserve punishment.
    
- Assumes Hell is a place God enjoys sending people to.
    
- Ignores the role of human **free will** and **moral accountability**.

## Supporting Evidence (Scientific / Historical / Logical):

- **Logical Consistency:**
    
    - Love **requires choice**. If God forces everyone into Heaven regardless of their heart, He removes choice—and thus love.
        
    - A just judge punishes evil. If God ignored sin, He would be corrupt or indifferent—not holy.
        
- **Moral Justice Framework:**
    
    - Every worldview must address evil and justice. Christianity offers **both mercy and judgment** through Jesus Christ.
        
- **Historical Example:**
    
    - Jesus spoke about Hell more than anyone else in the Bible—not out of cruelty, but as a warning. (See Matthew 5:22, 10:28, 13:42, Mark 9:43–48)

## Encouragement:

- God **loves deeply**—so much that He sent His own Son to take our punishment (John 3:16).
    
- Hell was **not created for humans**, but for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41).
    
- No one has to go to Hell—**salvation is freely offered** to everyone.
    
- > _“Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”_ — Romans 10:13

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Hell is not a torture chamber for people God hates—it is the **natural consequence** of rejecting the only source of life and goodness: God.
    
- **C.S. Lewis:** _“The doors of Hell are locked from the inside.”_  
    Many people choose pride, sin, or self over surrender to God.
    
- If Heaven is eternal joy with God, then Hell is eternal separation from Him—**a choice**, not an unjust punishment.
    
- A God who didn’t punish evil wouldn’t be **loving or just**—He’d be morally indifferent.

## Final Summary Answer:

- God doesn't _want_ anyone to go to Hell. He offers salvation to all—but some freely reject Him.
    
- Hell is not God’s failure to love, but humanity’s refusal to receive that love.
    
- His justice demands a response to sin, and His love provides the way out—through Jesus Christ.
