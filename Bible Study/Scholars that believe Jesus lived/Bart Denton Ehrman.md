### Why Bart Ehrman Matters

- He is a **non-Christian**, making his conclusions more compelling to skeptics.
    
- He strongly **refutes Jesus mythicism** (the idea that Jesus never existed).
    
- He affirms that **Jesus was a real person**, **crucified**, and **believed to have risen** by His followers.
    
- He confirms that these beliefs were held **very early**, not later inventions.

### Key Quotes from Bart Ehrman (in _Did Jesus Exist?_)

 “The reality is that every single author who mentions Jesus—pagan, Christian, or Jewish—was fully convinced that he at least lived. Even the enemies of the Jesus movement thought so; among their many slurs against the religion, his non-existence is never one of them.”

 “The claim that Jesus was simply made up falters on every ground.”

“With respect to Jesus, we have numerous, independent accounts of his life in the sources lying behind the Gospels and the writings of Paul—sources that originate in Jesus’ native tongue Aramaic and that can be dated to within just a year or two of his life.”

“There is no scholar in any college or university in the Western world who teaches classics, ancient history, New Testament, or early Christianity who doubts that Jesus existed.”
