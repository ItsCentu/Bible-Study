Evolution is based of 4 major claims or ideas.
## Short Answer:

- Evolution relies on **unobserved and unrepeatable assumptions** about origins, life, and complexity.
    
- It cannot explain **how life came from non-life**, or how **new information** is added to DNA.
    
- Minor variation within species (microevolution) is **not** proof of one kind evolving into another (macroevolution).

## What the Bible Says:

- > _“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”_ — Genesis 1:1
    
- > _“Then the LORD God formed man of dust… and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life…”_ — Genesis 2:7
    
- > _“Each according to its kind…”_ — Genesis 1:11–12, 21, 24–25
    
- > _“By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command…”_ — Hebrews 11:3
    
- > _“Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools…”_ — Romans 1:22
    

The Bible gives a **clear, direct creation account** — not an evolutionary one.

## Causes / Underlying Assumptions:

- Modern evolution assumes **naturalism** (no God or intelligent design).
    
- It depends on **materialism**: only what can be seen/tested is real.
    
- It assumes **uniformitarianism** — that everything has always happened the same way over millions of years.
    
- It also assumes **deep time**, **chance**, and **unguided processes** to explain design — instead of a Designer.

## Point-by-Point Breakdown:

### 1. **Life Comes from Non-Life (Abiogenesis):**

- No scientific experiment has ever created **life from non-life** without **intelligent input.**
    
- The **Miller-Urey experiment** did not create life—just some amino acids, under **artificial** and **unrealistic conditions**.
    
- **Law of Biogenesis**: Life always comes from life.
    

> Abiogenesis is not evolution, but evolution **depends on it** to get started.

**Biblical view:** God breathed life into man (Genesis 2:7).

### 2. **All Life Came from a Single Cell (Common Descent):**

- No direct fossil evidence connects **major kinds** (e.g., fish to amphibian, reptile to bird) with clear transitional forms.
    
- Most "transitional" fossils are **contested**, fragmentary, or later shown to be misclassified.
    
- **DNA complexity** in even “simple” life is massive — full of **coded information**.
    

> Information never comes from random chance — always from **intelligence**.

**Biblical view:** God created animals and humans **according to their kinds**, not from one common ancestor.

### 3. **Time and Chance Drive Evolution Forward:**

- Time and chance **degrade systems**, they don’t improve them (see 2nd Law of Thermodynamics).
    
- Mutations are overwhelmingly **harmful or neutral**, not creative or progressive.
    
- Random chance **can’t build** the specific, ordered systems we see in DNA, proteins, or organs.
    

> You wouldn’t expect tornadoes to build planes — yet evolution claims chaos built complex life.

**Biblical view:** Order, design, and purpose come from an **intentional Creator**.

### 4. **Microevolution Proves Macroevolution:**

- Yes, we observe **minor changes** (like dog breeds, finch beaks, bacterial resistance).
    
- But these are **within the same kind** — no new genetic information is added.
    
- **Microevolution** is adaptation, not transformation.

- Dog's do not become fish.

> No one has ever observed a **lizard becoming a bird**, or **a fish gaining lungs**.

**Biblical view:** Variation exists within kinds, but kinds remain fixed — just like Genesis describes.

## Encouragement:

- You don’t have to choose between **faith and reason**.
    
- The more we learn about DNA, microbiology, and cosmology, the **more evidence points to design**, not randomness.
    
- God’s Word and God’s world never truly contradict — **truth aligns with truth**.

## Defending the Faith (Apologetics Insight):

- Evolution is a **worldview**, not just science — it interprets facts through the lens of **naturalism**.
    
- Christians must recognize that science changes — but **God’s Word does not**.
    
- Many former evolutionists (like Dr. John Sanford, Dr. Michael Behe, or Lee Strobel) now affirm **intelligent design** or **biblical creation** after deep investigation.
    
- You are **not anti-science** for questioning evolution — you are pro-truth.

## Final Summary Answer:

- Evolution requires belief in **life from non-life**, unobserved macro changes, and the creative power of random chance — none of which have been proven.
    
- What we observe (adaptation within kinds, complexity, and information) **better fits creation**.
    
- The Bible gives a solid, eyewitness account of origins — and it stands strong in light of the evidence.
