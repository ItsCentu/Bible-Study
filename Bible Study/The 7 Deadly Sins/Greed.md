# What is Greed?
- **Definition:**  
    Greed (also called avarice) is an **excessive and selfish desire** for more — more wealth, more possessions, more status, or even more control — beyond what is needed or even good.  
    It’s not about having money — it’s about being **enslaved by it**.
    
- **At its root:** Greed says, _“God’s provision isn’t enough. I need more to feel secure or satisfied.”_

# How to Identify Greed

- You **never feel like it’s enough** — no matter how much you have.
    
- You often think about **making money** or **getting more**.
    
- You feel **tight-fisted**, even when you could help others.
    
- You compare your life to others and feel discontent.
    
- You use people to gain more — in business, relationships, or influence.
    
- You get **anxious or angry when money is threatened**.
    
- You **worship comfort** over obedience to God.

# Causes of Greed

- **Fear of lack** – Believing no one will take care of you (not even God).
    
- **Materialism** – Letting stuff define your identity or value.
    
- **Pride** – Thinking you deserve more than others.
    
- **Wounded identity** – Chasing wealth to feel worthy or respected.
    
- **Cultural conditioning** – We’re told more = better, always.

# What the Bible says about Greed

> _“The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.”_ — **1 Timothy 6:10**  
> _“Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”_ — **Luke 12:15**

#### Parables & Warnings:

- **The Rich Fool** (Luke 12:16–21) – A man hoards wealth for himself, then dies suddenly.  
    → **God calls him a fool** for storing treasure on earth but having nothing with God.
    
- **The Rich Young Ruler** (Matthew 19:16–24) – He wanted eternal life, but couldn’t give up his wealth.  
    → Jesus said: _“It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle...”_
    
- **Judas Iscariot** – Betrayed Jesus for silver. Greed literally sold the Savior.  
    (Matthew 26:14–16)

# What Greed Does to You

- Makes you **spiritually blind** — you can't see your own need for God.
    
- Numbs your compassion — people become “obstacles” or “tools.”
    
- Destroys generosity — which is a reflection of God's heart.
    
- Traps your soul — wealth becomes your god and security blanket.
    
- Breeds idolatry — it replaces trust in God with trust in stuff.

# Defending Against Greed

#### 1. **Practice radical generosity**

> _“It is more blessed to give than to receive.”_ — **Acts 20:35**  
> → Give until it stretches you. Break greed’s grip by being intentionally generous.

#### 2. **Live simply and gratefully**

> _“Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have.”_ — **Hebrews 13:5**  
> → Contentment kills greed.

#### 3. **Tithe and give offerings**

→ Don’t give God your leftovers — give Him your **first**. It trains your heart to trust Him, not your wallet.

#### 4. **Remember it all belongs to God**

> _“The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”_ — **Psalm 24:1**  
> → You’re not an owner — you’re a **steward**.

#### 5. **Serve others often**

→ Serving reminds you people matter more than possessions.

#### 6. **Fast from material things**

→ Take breaks from shopping, social media, or things that feed greed.

### ✝️ God’s Promise of Provision

> _“And my God will supply every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.”_  
> — **Philippians 4:19**

> _“Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”_  
> — **Matthew 6:33**
# Prayer against Lust

You are my Provider and my Portion.  
I confess that I have trusted in money more than I’ve trusted in You.  
I have chased comfort, status, and security instead of chasing Your Kingdom.  
Forgive me, Lord.

Break the power of greed in my life.  
Teach me to give freely, to live simply, and to trust You completely.  
Remind me that **everything I have is Yours**, and I am just passing through this world.  
Let me be known not by what I have, but by how I love.  
In Jesus’ name,  
**Amen.**
