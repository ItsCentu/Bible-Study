# What Wrath Lust?

- **Definition:**  
    Wrath is not just anger — it's **explosive, vengeful rage** that seeks harm, control, or dominance. It often stems from a deep wound or pride, and can manifest in **violence**, **hatred**, or **cold-hearted unforgiveness**.
    
- **Key distinction:**  
    _Righteous anger_ grieves sin and injustice (like Jesus flipping tables).  
    _Wrath_ seeks destruction and control, not healing or justice.
    
- **At its root:** Wrath says, _“I will punish you. I deserve vengeance. I must be feared or respected.”_

# Causes of Wrath?

- **Wounded pride** – Feeling humiliated, rejected, or disrespected.
    
- **Unhealed trauma** – Past wounds (especially childhood) that fuel explosive reactions.
    
- **Bitterness** – Holding onto offenses and letting them rot inside.
    
- **Power/control obsession** – Needing to dominate or “win” in conflict.
    
- **Spiritual oppression** – Anger is often used by the enemy to destroy relationships and peace.
# How to Identify Wrath

- You explode over small things (rage, yelling, intimidation).
    
- You hold grudges, seek revenge, or wish harm on others.
    
- You stew silently with bitterness or emotional shutdown.
    
- You struggle to forgive — even when you want to.
    
- You replay offenses over and over in your mind.
    
- You use your anger to **manipulate or dominate** others.
    
- You lash out, then feel guilt — but repeat the cycle again.

# What Wrath Does to You.

- **Destroys relationships** – Friends, marriages, families — all break under wrath.
    
- **Clouds your judgment** – You say and do things you regret deeply.
    
- **Harms your body** – Chronic anger causes stress, heart issues, and more.
    
- **Invites spiritual attack** – The enemy uses wrath as a back door into your soul.
    
- **Keeps you chained to the past** – Unforgiveness is a prison you live in alone.

# Defending Against Wrath?

#### 1. **Pause and pray**

> _“Be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.”_ — **James 1:19**  
> → Anger demands action. Wisdom demands **restraint**.

#### 2. **Name the real wound**

→ Ask: _“What am I actually angry about? Is it pride? Rejection? Fear?”_

#### 3. **Forgive even when it hurts**

> _“Forgive one another, as God in Christ forgave you.”_ — **Ephesians 4:32**  
> → Forgiveness is **not weakness** — it’s warfare.

#### 4. **Confess and confess again**

→ Wrath doesn’t disappear with time — it must be surrendered daily.

#### 5. **Fast from control**

→ Control is often what wrath is really about. Give it back to God.

#### 6. **Practice gentleness on purpose**

→ Be deliberate: speak calmly, listen humbly, walk away if needed. _Gentleness is not passivity — it’s power under control._

# Encouragement.

> _“Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you… Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.”_  
> — **Ephesians 4:31–32**

> _“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.”_  
> — **Matthew 5:9**

You weren’t made to burn with rage — you were made to **carry peace like a sword.**

# Prayer against Wrath.

**Father,**

You see the fire in my chest — the wounds, the fury, the tension that builds up.  
You know where it comes from: the hurt, the pride, the fear of being dishonored.  
I don’t want to live this way anymore.

Forgive me, Lord, for lashing out, for simmering with rage, for using anger to hide my pain.  
Cleanse me of wrath.  
Break its cycle in my life — the explosions, the silence, the damage I cause.

Teach me to respond, not react.  
Teach me to breathe, not break.  
Teach me to forgive, not fight.

Fill me with gentleness — not weakness, but **power under Your control**.  
Help me to remember that You are my Defender.  
You see what was done to me — and You will bring justice in Your time.

I surrender my anger to You.  
Let it burn on Your altar, not inside my bones.

**Replace wrath with wisdom.  
Replace rage with righteousness.  
Replace revenge with rest.**

In the name of Jesus,  
**Amen.**
