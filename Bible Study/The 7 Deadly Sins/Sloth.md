# What Is Sloth?

- **Definition:**  
    Sloth isn’t just laziness — it’s **apathy toward God**, toward purpose, and toward growth. It’s choosing **ease over effort**, **comfort over calling**, and **passivity over obedience**.
    
- **It’s not rest** (rest is biblical).  
    It’s **neglect** of what matters: spiritual growth, purpose, and discipline.
    
- **At its root:** Sloth says, _“It’s too hard. It doesn’t matter. I’ll do it later.”_

# Causes of Sloth?

- **Fear of failure** – You avoid trying because you fear not being enough.
    
- **Comfort addiction** – You numb yourself with entertainment, food, or distractions.
    
- **Depression or discouragement** – Emotional heaviness can cause spiritual retreat.
    
- **Lack of purpose** – If you don’t know your “why,” you lose your “how.”
    
- **Spiritual dullness** – A hardened heart no longer feels urgency or hunger for God.
# How to Identify Sloth

- You **delay things that require effort**, especially spiritual ones.
    
- You **avoid responsibility** or drift through life with no urgency.
    
- You say things like “I’m just not motivated” or “God will understand” — as excuses.
    
- You **feel empty**, bored, or dull — even when doing “nothing wrong.”
    
- You neglect prayer, Scripture, or service, and don’t feel convicted.
    
- You avoid purpose-driven discomfort, choosing passive comfort instead.
    
- You often say, “I’ll start tomorrow,” and **never do.**

# What Sloth Does to You.

- **Blocks your calling** – You were made for impact — sloth turns that fire cold.

# Defending Against Sloth?

#### 1. **Embrace spiritual discipline**

> _“Train yourself to be godly.”_ — **1 Timothy 4:7**  
> → Don’t wait for motivation. Start with discipline. **Motivation follows obedience.**

#### 2. **Set spiritual routines**

→ Start with small, daily habits: prayer, Word, journaling, purpose planning.

#### 3. **Surround yourself with driven believers**

> _“As iron sharpens iron...”_ — **Proverbs 27:17**  
> → A fired-up community will challenge your spiritual comfort zone.

#### 4. **Focus on your calling**

→ You have a mission. Discover it, pursue it, and fight to protect it from apathy.

#### 5. **Serve others**

→ Self-centeredness feeds sloth. Serving reawakens purpose.

#### 6. **Fast from distractions**

→ Sloth thrives on mindless scrolling, endless shows, and shallow entertainment. **Cut it off when needed.**

# Prayer against Sloth.

**Father,**

You did not call me to waste my life.  
You gave me gifts, time, and breath — not for passivity, but for purpose.  
I confess the slowness in my spirit, the laziness in my flesh, and the distractions that pull me from what matters.

I’ve delayed obedience. I’ve postponed discipline.  
I’ve traded passion for passivity.  
Forgive me, Lord.

Awaken my soul. Stir my spirit.  
Light a fire inside me that refuses to settle.  
Break every comfort addiction.  
Call me out of the fog of apathy and into the clarity of mission.

Help me rise early, pray fervently, serve joyfully, and live intentionally.  
Let every moment count.  
Let every gift be used.  
Let every day be filled with holy purpose.

**Make me diligent, not dormant.  
Make me faithful, not forgetful.**

I am Yours — fully, actively, and obediently.

In Jesus’ name,  
**Amen.**
