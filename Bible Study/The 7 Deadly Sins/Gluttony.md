# What Is Gluttony?

- **Definition:**  
    Gluttony is the **overindulgence in food, drink, or physical pleasures** to the point where it begins to control you, rather than you controlling it.  
    It’s not just eating too much — it’s **using consumption as a way to escape, numb, or worship comfort**.
    
- **Modern view:** Gluttony is about excess in anything that feeds the **flesh over the spirit** — food, entertainment, dopamine, even social media.
    
- **Key difference:**  
    Eating = good.  
    Enjoying = fine.  
    **Needing it to feel OK or fulfilled?** That’s when it crosses the line.

# Causes of Gluttony?

- You eat or drink **when you’re not hungry**, out of emotion or boredom.
    
- You use food or other indulgences to **escape problems** or feelings.
    
- You **can’t say no** to cravings.
    
- You feel **shame, guilt, or sluggishness** afterward.
    
- You **obsess over food**, comfort, or constant pleasure.
    
- You avoid fasting or self-denial at all costs.
    
- You let your **flesh dictate your decisions**, not the Spirit.
# How to Identify Gluttony

- **Emotional pain** – Using food/pleasure to numb instead of healing.
    
- **Boredom and spiritual dryness** – Trying to fill a soul void with fleshly stuff.
    
- **Lack of self-control** – Letting impulse rule instead of discipline.
    
- **Addiction to dopamine** – Constant craving for the next “feel good” moment.
    
- **Cultural excess** – We live in a world of endless choices and zero limits.

# What the Bible says about Gluttony.

> _“Put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony.”_  
> — **Proverbs 23:2** (a harsh but sobering warning)

> _“Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat, for drunkards and gluttons become poor.”_  
> — **Proverbs 23:20–21**

> _“So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.”_  
> — **1 Corinthians 10:31**

> _“Their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame...”_  
> — **Philippians 3:19**

#### Examples in Scripture:

- **Esau** sold his birthright for a single meal — a moment of appetite cost him his inheritance.  
    _(Genesis 25:29–34)_
    
- **The Israelites** complained and gorged themselves on meat in the wilderness, and God sent a plague.  
    _(Numbers 11)_

# What Gluttony Does to You.

- **Weakens your self-control** – The more you feed it, the harder it is to say no.
    
- **Clouds your spirit** – Gluttony numbs sensitivity to the Holy Spirit.
    
- **Breaks your health** – Overindulgence leads to fatigue, disease, and sloth.
    
- **Distracts your purpose** – It steals time, focus, and energy meant for God’s Kingdom.
    
- **Hides spiritual hunger** – You stop craving God when your flesh is always full.

# Defending Against Gluttony?

#### 1. **Practice fasting**

> _“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.”_ — **Matthew 4:4**  
> → Fasting is **gluttony’s natural enemy** — it teaches discipline and spiritual hunger.

#### 2. **Invite God into your habits**

→ Don’t just pray over food — **pray about food**.  
→ Ask: “Why do I want this right now? Am I hungry… or hiding?”

#### 3. **Exercise gratitude and moderation**

> _“Give us this day our daily bread…”_ — **Matthew 6:11**  
> → Be content with enough. You don’t need excess to be blessed.

#### 4. **Confess and reset when you slip**

→ Don’t fall into shame — gluttony thrives in guilt cycles.  
→ Confess, reset, and move forward with intention.

#### 5. **Feed your soul more than your flesh**

→ Prioritize Scripture, prayer, worship, and meaningful purpose over passive comfort.

# Encouragement.

### God’s Desire for You

> _“I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.”_  
> — **1 Corinthians 9:27**

> _“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.”_  
> — **Matthew 5:6**

You were made to **feast on the presence of God**, not be enslaved by the table of the world.

# Prayer against Gluttony.

**Father,**

You are my portion and my satisfaction.  
You gave me the gift of food, rest, and pleasure — not to control me, but to bless me.  
But I confess that I’ve let these gifts become **idols of comfort and escape**.  
I’ve used food and indulgence to run from pain instead of running to You.

Forgive me, Lord.  
Teach me to discipline my body and renew my mind.  
Let me crave Your Word more than I crave sugar.  
Let me hunger for righteousness more than I hunger for comfort.

Help me fast with purpose, eat with gratitude, and live with restraint.  
Break every chain of addiction or emotional dependence.  
You are enough for me. You are the Bread of Life.  
And You are worthy of a temple that honors You.

**Fill me with Your Spirit — and not my cravings.**

In Jesus’ name,  
**Amen.**
