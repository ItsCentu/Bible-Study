# What Is Envy?

- **Definition:**  
    Envy is a **resentful longing** for what someone else has — their success, looks, status, relationships, gifts, or blessings. It’s deeper than jealousy.  
    **Jealousy says:** “I want what you have.”  
    **Envy says:** “I want what you have… and I don’t want you to have it.”
    
- It’s not about admiration — it’s about **comparison that breeds bitterness**.
    
- **At its root:** Envy says, _“God was unfair to me.”_
# Causes of Envy?

- **Insecurity** – When you don’t know who you are, you want to be who someone else is.
    
- **Comparison culture** – Social media, entertainment, and modern life fuel envy daily.
    
- **Unhealed identity wounds** – Feeling overlooked, forgotten, or unworthy.
    
- **Pride** – Believing you deserve more than others.
    
- **Misunderstanding God’s timing** – Thinking someone else’s blessing is proof that God skipped you.
# How to Identify Envy

- You feel **bitter or sad** when others succeed or receive praise.
    
- You constantly **compare yourself** to others in looks, gifts, status, or relationships.
    
- You secretly **hope others fail** so you feel better.
    
- You struggle to **celebrate others** without thinking about yourself.
    
- You **speak negatively** about people who seem “ahead of you.”
    
- You feel like you’re **always behind**, no matter what you achieve.
    
- You’re restless and ungrateful, even when blessed.

# What the Bible says about Envy.

> _“A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.”_  
> — **Proverbs 14:30**

> _“Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong.”_  
> — **Psalm 37:1**

> _“Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.”_  
> — **Galatians 5:26**

#### Examples in Scripture:

- **Cain envied Abel’s favor** with God — and killed him out of resentment (Genesis 4).
    
- **Joseph’s brothers envied his dreams** and threw him into a pit (Genesis 37).
    
- **Saul envied David’s victories** and tried to kill him (1 Samuel 18).
    
- **The Pharisees envied Jesus** — and plotted His death (Mark 15:10).

# What Envy Does to You.

- **Kills gratitude** – You stop seeing what God has given _you_.
    
- **Destroys relationships** – You can’t love people you secretly resent.
    
- **Steals joy** – Even blessings feel bitter because someone has “more.”
    
- **Breeds gossip, slander, and division**.
    
- **Leads to self-hate or pride** — depending on how you compare.

# Defending Against Envy?

#### 1. **Practice daily gratitude**

> _“Give thanks in all circumstances…”_ — **1 Thessalonians 5:18**  
> → Thank God specifically for what you _do_ have. Write it out. Speak it aloud.

#### 2. **Celebrate others out loud**

→ Rejoice with those who are winning — even if you aren’t.  
→ _“Rejoice with those who rejoice…”_ — **Romans 12:15**

#### 3. **Break comparison cycles**

→ Log off social media if needed. Stop scrolling through other people’s “highlight reels.”

#### 4. **Remember your assignment**

→ You weren’t called to copy someone else’s race — God made you for a unique path.  
→ _“We are God’s workmanship, created… for good works He prepared for us to do.”_ — **Ephesians 2:10**

#### 5. **Bless those you're tempted to envy**

→ Pray for their continued success. Nothing breaks envy faster.

# Encouragement.

> _“Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else.”_  
> — **Galatians 6:4**

> _“Whoever is faithful with little will be entrusted with much.”_  
> — **Luke 16:10**

God sees you. You’re not forgotten. His blessing for someone else is **not** a curse for you — it's just **not your turn yet**. Your season will come.

# Prayer against Envy.

**Father,**

I confess that envy has crept into my heart — through my comparisons, my pride, and my insecurity.  
I’ve looked at others with resentment instead of love.  
I’ve questioned Your goodness when I saw them blessed and myself seemingly overlooked.

Forgive me for doubting Your plan for me.  
Cleanse me of every bitter root.  
Silence the lies that say I’m not enough — or that You’ve forgotten me.

Help me to celebrate others freely.  
Help me to see myself rightly — as loved, chosen, and made on purpose.  
Help me to run **my race**, not someone else’s.

I surrender all comparison.  
I give You my insecurity.  
I ask You to replace envy with gratitude, peace, and fierce joy.

Let me bless those I once envied.  
Let me overflow with thankfulness.  
Let me live secure in Your timing and Your design.

In Jesus’ name,  
**Amen.**
