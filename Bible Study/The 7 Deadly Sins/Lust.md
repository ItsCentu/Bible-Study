# What is lust?
- **Definition:**  
    Lust is an intense, **self-centered craving for sexual pleasure**, fantasy, or control, usually at the expense of purity, others, and God’s will.  
    Unlike love, which gives, **lust takes**. It turns people into **objects**, not souls.
    
- **Biblical Greek word:** _epithymia_ (ἐπιθυμία) – means “over-desire” or “intense craving,” not always sexual, but often used in that context.

# How to Identify Lust
- You view someone as a **thing to be used**, not a person made in God’s image.
    
- You seek pleasure **outside of God’s boundaries** (marriage).
    
- You feed your mind with **fantasy**, **pornography**, or **impure thoughts**.
    
- You justify or hide your actions (“It’s not hurting anyone”).
    
- You feel constant **guilt or shame** afterward.
    
- You lose control: it **dominates your thoughts, time, and will**.

# Causes of Lust

- **Unhealed wounds** – Past rejection, betrayal, loneliness, or abuse.
    
- **Boredom and idleness** – Lust thrives in an empty heart or idle hands.
    
- **Lack of intimacy with God** – A cold spiritual life creates craving for fleshly comfort.
    
- **Pornography** – Warps your brain to seek instant gratification.
    
- **Trauma bonding** – Craving validation or intimacy through impurity.
    
- **Culture saturation** – Media normalizes sex without covenant, stripping holiness.

# What the Bible says about Lust
#### Jesus:

> _“You have heard it said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I tell you that anyone who **looks at a woman lustfully** has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”_  
> — **Matthew 5:27–28**

#### Paul:

> _“Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually **sins against their own body**.”_  
> — **1 Corinthians 6:18**

#### Peter:

> _“Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.”_  
> — **1 Peter 2:11**

#### Old Testament:

- **David and Bathsheba** – David’s lust led to adultery, deception, and murder.  
    _(2 Samuel 11)_
    
- **Samson** – His lust for Delilah led to his capture and downfall.  
    _(Judges 16)_
    
- **Solomon** – His lust and obsession with foreign women led to idolatry.  
    _(1 Kings 11)_

# What Lust Does to You

- **Distorts Love** – Lust offers the shadow of connection without sacrifice.
    
- **Breaks your mind** – Porn rewires your brain, decreasing satisfaction, self-control, and relational health.
    
- **Kills your spirit** – Guilt, shame, and spiritual numbness follow.
    
- **Invites demonic bondage** – Lust opens doors for spiritual oppression.
    
- **Destroys relationships** – It turns real intimacy into performance or avoidance.

# Defending Against Lust
#### 1. **Flee** – Not fight. Flee.

> “Flee youthful lusts...” — **2 Timothy 2:22**  
> → _Don’t negotiate with temptation. Run like Joseph from Potiphar’s wife (Genesis 39)._

#### 2. **Guard your eyes and ears**

> “I have made a covenant with my eyes...” — **Job 31:1**  
> → Avoid media, music, games, or apps that stir temptation.

#### 3. **Confess in community**

> “Confess your sins to one another...” — **James 5:16**  
> → Secrecy is lust’s weapon. Accountability disarms it.

#### 4. **Fast and discipline your body**

> “I discipline my body and keep it under control...” — **1 Corinthians 9:27**  
> → Denying comfort helps break fleshly habits.

#### 5. **Daily prayer and Word**

→ Replace lies with truth.  
→ Psalms, Proverbs, Matthew 5, 1 Corinthians 6, and Romans 6–8 are spiritual weapons.

#### 6. **See people as souls**

→ Train your mind to **see women/men as God’s children**, not objects.

#### 7. **Worship**

→ Worship shifts your desire from **what is sensual** to **what is sacred**.

### 🕊️ God’s Promise of Freedom

> _“No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.”_  
> — **1 Corinthians 10:13**

> _“Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.”_  
> — **Galatians 5:16**

You’re not alone. **God gives power, escape, and restoration.**  
The enemy says you’re stuck. God says, _“Get up, you’re mine. Let’s start over.”_

# Encouragement

If you’ve struggled with lust (as many have), here’s the truth:

- You are not beyond saving.
    
- You are not defined by your past.
    
- You are not disqualified from being used by God.
    
- Jesus forgives, restores, and **empowers purity** through the Holy Spirit.

# Prayer against Lust
I come before You not pretending to be strong, but confessing my weakness.  
You know every thought, every battle, every secret — nothing is hidden from You.  
You see the war inside me, and You don’t run from me.  
You are my refuge.

Right now, I reject lust in all its forms — in my mind, in my eyes, in my heart, and in my body.  
I confess any sin I’ve committed in this area. Forgive me, Lord.  
Wash me in the blood of Jesus. Cleanse me from all unrighteousness.

I surrender my flesh to You, Holy Spirit.  
Crucify my desires that rebel against You.  
Let me not feed what kills me. Let me not desire what defiles me.

Train my eyes to see with purity.  
Train my heart to love with holiness.  
Help me treat people as souls — not objects, not fantasies — but Your creation.

When temptation comes, help me run — not reason.  
When my flesh rises, help me stand — not stumble.  
When shame whispers, remind me I’m Yours — not discarded.

Give me a mind full of Scripture, not shadows.  
Give me a spirit of power, love, and self-control.  
Make me fierce in battle, humble in spirit, and victorious through Christ.

Where there was bondage, bring freedom.  
Where there was darkness, bring light.  
Where there was addiction, bring healing.  
Where there was secrecy, bring truth.

Jesus, I don’t just want to avoid sin — I want to walk in purity.  
Not out of fear, but out of love. Not just to be clean, but to be close to You.

**I want You more than I want pleasure.  
I want holiness more than I want comfort.  
I want to be free.**

So clothe me in armor. Surround me with fire.  
And if I fall, help me rise again — quickly, honestly, and in Your strength.

In the mighty name of Jesus,  
**Amen.**
