# What Is Pride?

Pride is the **exaltation of self** over God, others, and truth. It is the attitude that says, _“I know better,”_ _“I deserve more,”_ or _“I am above correction.”_  
It refuses to submit, refuses to admit wrong, and fights to be in control — even at the cost of others.

Pride is not the same as healthy confidence. Pride is **self-idolatry**. It puts your will, opinion, image, and desires on the throne — instead of God.

> _“Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.”_ — **Proverbs 16:18**

# Causes of Pride?

- **Insecurity** disguised as superiority — needing others to think highly of you to feel okay
    
- **Success or power** without surrender — forgetting where your blessings came from
    
- **Comparison and competition** — needing to “win” or be “better than”
    
- **Rebellion against authority** — rejecting correction or structure
    
- **Wounded ego** — past rejection leading to a hardened heart that won’t be vulnerable
    
- **Spiritual deception** — believing you’re morally superior to others, even before God

# What the Bible says about Pride.

_“God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.”_ — **James 4:6**  
_“These six things the Lord hates… a proud look…”_ — **Proverbs 6:16–17**  
_“When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.”_ — **Proverbs 11:2**  
_“Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will lift you up.”_ — **James 4:10**

### Biblical Examples:

- **Lucifer** was cast out of heaven for pride (Isaiah 14:12–15).
    
- **Adam and Eve** ate the fruit believing they could be “like God.”
    
- **Pharaoh** hardened his heart, refusing to yield to God — it destroyed Egypt.
    
- **Nebuchadnezzar** bragged about his kingdom and was humbled like a beast (Daniel 4).
    
- **The Pharisees** clung to pride and rejected Jesus, the very Messiah they studied.

# How to Identify Pride

- You **resist correction** or refuse to admit when you’re wrong.
    
- You frequently compare yourself to others and feel superior.
    
- You feel angry or defensive when challenged.
    
- You **struggle to apologize** or ask for help.
    
- You secretly believe **others are the problem** more than you.
    
- You desire **recognition, status, or control**, even in spiritual things.
    
- You downplay your sins and highlight others’ faults.

# What Pride Does to You.

- **Separates you from God** – Pride was the original sin and still blocks intimacy with Him.
    
- **Hardens your heart** – Making you unteachable and cold.
    
- **Destroys relationships** – Pride turns love into power struggles.
    
- **Fuels every other sin** – Lust, envy, wrath, greed, etc., all grow in the soil of pride.
    
- **Blinds you to truth** – Pride convinces you that you don’t need help, change, or grace.
    
- **Sets you up for a fall** – Scripture promises pride will eventually collapse (Proverbs 16:18).

# Defending Against Pride?

### 1. **Pursue humility daily**

> _“Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.”_ — **1 Peter 5:6**  
> → Humility isn’t thinking less of yourself — it’s thinking of yourself **less**.

### 2. **Confess and repent regularly**

→ Pride hides sin. Repentance uproots it. Name it. Own it. Kill it.

### 3. **Let others correct you**

> _“Faithful are the wounds of a friend…”_ — **Proverbs 27:6**  
> → Accountability is spiritual armor.

### 4. **Serve in secret**

→ Serve without being seen. Honor without being thanked. Give without being praised.

### 5. **Study the humility of Jesus**

→ He washed feet. He sat with outcasts. He **lowered Himself** to save you (Philippians 2:5–8).

# Encouragement.

Pride may be ancient, but **it’s not unbeatable**.  
Every time you choose humility, you defeat Satan at the very thing that caused his fall.  
Every time you repent, you open the door for grace.  
Every time you submit to God, you’re being lifted up in His strength — not yours.

> _“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”_ — **Matthew 5:3**

You don’t have to prove yourself. You don’t have to be worshiped. You don’t have to be perfect.  
**You just need to be surrendered.**

# Prayer against Pride.

**Father,**

You are high and holy — and I am small.  
But so often, I try to take Your place.  
I build my own image. I defend my own name. I fight to be right, instead of righteous.

I confess the pride in my heart — the times I thought I knew better, the times I refused correction, the moments I craved applause.  
Forgive me.

Tear down the throne I’ve built for myself.  
Break my obsession with being seen, heard, praised, or envied.  
Help me to think less about myself and more about You.  
Teach me the way of Jesus — humble, gentle, obedient, and powerful through surrender.

May I walk in **true strength** — the kind that doesn’t need to prove anything.  
Let every word I speak come from love, not pride.  
Let every success I receive point to You, not me.

**Kill my pride.  
Raise up humility.  
Make me more like Christ.**

In Jesus’ name,  
**Amen.**
