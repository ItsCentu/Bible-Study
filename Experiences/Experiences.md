##### Chapter 1 Between Good and Evil

This is not a record that in any way is meant to add or replace anything in the Bible. This is but a log of experiences that I am witnessing. My name is Noah. Son of Seth and Cheryl. The experiences I have witnessed are undeniable. The work of both God and the Devil. Words written down thousands of years ago, both past and future, are coming true before my own and billions of others' eyes. (1)

Celebration of sin, the Rebirth of Nations, people falling away from Faith. Many believe this is the time leading up to the tribulation and rapture. Our world is breaking. Many wars and world tensions are growing. People are killing each other. Anger rises; not just nation against nation, but from within. The biggest threat to the nation I live in is our own people. Ever since the murder of a man known as Charlie Kirk, and the celebration of it, it has been title against title. Republican vs. Democratic, Liberal vs. the World. When will people open their eyes? Are we so simple-minded as to blame everyone because of one? This is not a fact of a title against title. However, it is Good vs Evil. (2)

A pure Red Heifer was found in Israel, and many believe this connects to the ordinance given in Numbers 19:2. Some see this as prophetically significant, as preparations for sacrifice have been discussed. (3)

However, many stand idly by, ignoring it, or are just too blind or scared to see it. All we can do is have Faith. Revenge is God's, not ours. We have the ultimate weapon against all evil, yet we stand around twiddling our thumbs and hoping that it will just walk away. Pray, have faith in our Lord, our Father, our God. The faith the size of a mustard seed. Believe in all your hearts, because He is all we have, and He is all we need. (4)

I eagerly await the return of my Lord and the end of this. (5)

From what I have come to learn during my time studying and speaking to many about their faiths, is that most of the ones who do not believe in God come from the misinterpretation of the bible. They speak of contradictions; however, I have learned that the contradictions that they spoke of were not contradictions at all, they just were unable to understand what they had read. This is because they are only reading words. They do not understand because they can not read, and that is the truth. When I say they cannot read, I mean they lack the literal skills to read well, and many are spiritually unable to understand without God's work in their hearts. When people in this day and age read, they don't read to understand; they don't study, they don't do their own research. Many have criticized me, speaking, saying that they knew the bible better than I. I do not fight back, because maybe they were right. Yet, how can they still be blinded to their surroundings? Willful ignorance? Perhaps. However, what I earned from correcting and assisting others was hate and backlash. So I wipe the dust from my feet and move on to the next person I can assist, and am willing to listen to learn, rather than listen to listen. (6)

Many call me arrogant; maybe they are correct; some call me wise, but I beg to differ. I am not wise; it should not take someone like me to be able to see what is happening. I am but a humble, ignorant man reading God's wise words and writing what I see. (7)

The school system, what should be learning, is both working and not. Sure, many become educated; this is true, however, just because you learn does not mean you understand how to use that knowledge or control it. Sin runs rampant without restraint. People talking lustfully, Wrath without kindness, arrogance without humility, and greed without content. This is what Paul describes in Romans 1: knowledge of God and truth exists, yet many suppress it and fall into corruption. (8)

##### Chapter 2 Lukewarm faith vs. true works.

How can one be so blind? How many times must you be pelted by water before you realize that it’s not been raining but storming the entire time? How can the blind see more than those with 20/20 vision? Is this willful ignorance or something else in disguise? We view passages in the Bible as a simple coincidence; however, we look away from the fact that it was still written down. How many times must this happen? The proof is in the pages, yet when read, they are not read, but overlooked. They are not studied but forgotten. How do you expect to find truth when your book remains closed? How do you expect to find wisdom when you don’t learn? How do you expect to see when your eyes remain shut? (1)

For those who say they believe yet do not do works, how can you be so lukewarm? Faith without works is dead (James 2:14-26), yet you preach as if you have not read a single word of God. Do you even read? How can you look at a fellow brother or sister of Christ and lie to them? How can you harm them while calling yourself a follower of God? You hypocrites. How do you dare to call yourself a believer in God, yet go on about this wrongdoing? Is the excuse that you are human? Will you use that excuse when you face God? Just because you believe in God does not make you a true believer. Do His works. Spread His words. When you face the mighty power of God, bring others with you; do not go alone. (2)

Yet for those who truly follow, for those who act in faith, many true believers will find that as they draw closer to God, the harder their lives become. Do not be afraid, our God, our Father, is with us already paving the way. Use your ultimate weapon, your faith, do not waver in the eyes of evil; instead, believe and pray. This life is but a timer, the timer to eternity. Hold your cross high, do not fall; believe and you will never fall from God's holy place. Instead, believe, and someday you will fly. (3)

Fellow follower and believer of God, our lord, be careful with what you say. Words were given by God; however, your words are dependent on how you use the gift of God that is Free Will. The tongue is a serpent, which can either break or build up others. (James 3:5–10) Instead, tame that snake and use it to spread the great word of God. Assist others, and bring them close. Encourage, and pray. Instead of being a snake, be the morning dove. The shining star in the blackness of space. (4)

Friends, I understand that it is hard to fight temptation, but we must if we want to stay on God's holy ground. Cut off whatever is making you sin, and go and sin no more. To truly repent is to turn away from what is causing you to sin, so you do not fall into it any longer. Do not let it control your life. Is it not God's graciousness that he allows free will? So why do you let temptation guide you away? Take control, be disciplined, and sin no more. (5)

Live your life like you actually want to live. Don't stay attached to your sins. Do not let yourself be drowned, don't be anchored. Instead, give your life to our father, the king of the universe. Be truly free, and once you obtain that freedom, use it and help others who are trapped where you once were. Don't look away from God, as he would never look away from you. Instead embrace his love, and use that love to love others. We were made in the image of God, don't lower yourself in disrespecting another's appearance. Do not judge another, or you yourself will be judged. Instead praise, and praise in the lord who is our God. (6)
